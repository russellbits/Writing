title: A Letter from Reza to his Disciples

It should be known that the passage of this life is a passage. It is a coming and going. However, the passage cannot be one that could succumb to desire. Whatsoever possession of will or need that one might have, must pass as well. The desire for things material and sustaining must surely pass. However, other desires will pass as will. The desire for company will pass. The desire for a sense of self and identity will pass. The desire for love... will pass. All that which is connected to the flesh will pass away and be left here on Earth.

It is the thinest of connections that we have to our former majesty and consciousness. This cord is so thin, in fact, that it cannot even influence our bodies and our actions here while we are mortal. And that would not be its purpose. Our minds are but a conduit for a great, vast consciousness that, grandly, exists in higher dimensions that the simple ones for space and time that we all know. Higher consciousness is witness to all time, exists for all time, and it is only here that we are explorers for that consciousness as it takes us on a journey of wants and needs, of time, space and self, of love and hate. We are each of us experiments in a grand calculation.

We, all of us, from the moment we come into existence, have the thinest of tendrils of connection to the higher dimensions, where our own experiences are added to the noosphere—the plain in which Knowledge and Truth exist.

What we experience now is only one way of an infinitude that this Universe could occur. We are experiments, as are our bonds, as is our world. And even in that, our Universe is only one of the many ways that a Universe may occur. We are witness to one set of rules that are calculated from an infinitude, that are brought into existence forever and ever, but also, from the gates of Heaven, only just, in an instant.

You will ask, as must be asked of existence, why and what for? You will ask about justice. Understand: morality is necessarily the stuff of the flesh and not a grand consciousness that must, by definition of its very existence, explore all the paths and ways and means of Creation. Morality is the stuff of the atom and you should not, if you wish to be enlightened, concern yourself with it. You are of the atom, of star stuff, of the very basic fundamental laws that govern this Universe. And you are watched. It is of no concern to the Watchers if you are good or evil. To them, both of these fundamental concerns are whim and dependent on and in the first millionths of a second when a Universe begins to unfold.

Acolytes of Reza, behold: It is decided. Even the Gods of old come from these early moments in the birth of a Universe, for if anything in this Universe can conceive, then It is decided, and the Watchers will add the knowledge to the Noosphere. And to ask what came before? What came before witness and what came before the substance and the laws, and the answer is simple. Without witness, there is nothing.

Know these things. It is decided and without witness, there is nothing.

	Many of the followers of Jesus Christ—who knew of these forces and Watchers of which I speak—they believe in asking forgiveness. It is true that one should ask for forgiveness, but it is folly to believe that the Universe will grant it. The wounds we afflict on this construct contain both learning and regret.
