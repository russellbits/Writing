title: The House of Reason

I open my eyes and I see Josie. My mouth rips down at the edges and I cry. Her face is just exactly as I had been dreaming and her face is like... It's Josie and it doesn't matter what it's like. I'm done writing. I don't cry, scratch that. I sob. I put my head into her chest and sob. I can hear her say, "I know, I know." I look up and I try to reach up to hold her face but my arms won't work. I shudder instead. "It's okay," she says. "I'm here." She has no idea what it means—what *here* means. Am I really out? There are lights all around, pulsing, flashing blue and red lights and its dark in a forest. I'm not really sure the nightmare is over. But, she runs her hand across my head and I do know that it's over. That touch is real. I put my head into her shoulder once more and then I am desperate to know, "Anna!" Josie pushes me upright and points and there is my blessed little girl. I reach out to grab her but again I can't function. I try anyway out of desperation and I just collapse on the ground. "Allen!" shouts Josie.

I am lying on the ground, still awake, looking up at branches that contrast the dusk, a warm blanket wrapped around me, and in the confusing shock of ambulance lights I see Josie and Anna standing over me. "Daddy!" shouts Anna. "Come here, baby girl." Anna gets on her knees and wraps her tiny arms around my neck and God does not know how good that feels. Josie holds my hand and I cry some more. "My little girl," I say, and I also squeeze Josie's hand hard. "Thank God. Thank God," is all I can say. "Oh, thank God."

I come out of it in pieces; the drug. Brought up from the ground, I am seated on the bumper of the ambulance with Josie and Anna at my side, blanket wrapped around all of us. Everything from being on the ground that I can remember is just a blur of smiles and holds and relief. But, eventually, I look up from that happy gaussian nothing—that dream in real life—and there is Samantha Cobb in her suit and trench coat. I relent, step away from the bliss, engage reality. "Detective," I say.

"Allen."

"What happened?"

"Horimizad," she says and shrugs.

"You found us."

"Thanks to you and those letters."

"Thank you, Samantha."

"You're welcome."

"Ezra?"

"I don't know, but you don't have to worry about these people anymore. We'll talk later."
