title: Distractions and Thanks
---

I've been so self-involved, it never even occurred to me to mention something very important. I mean to say it here, but hope that no one ever reads it. And I promise to make a proper thanks to everyone who has reached out to me. For now, though, this will have to do.

After a call to the Department chair and later the Dean of the school at the University where I work, to explain what was happening, I was inundated with kindness. First off, the department relieved me of all teaching duties for the foreseeable time. But more than that, I suppose that word got out what was happening and my inbox has been piled into with kind words, prayers, and hopes.[^21] Many of the emails offered several kinds of support or even voluntary investigative work—offers I obviously could not accept—but amazing offers nonetheless.

After the botched drop off, I came home to find piles of flowers at my doorstep. I stood and looked at them for quite some time, in awe of the unfettered kindness that people can extend when someone is in trouble. I didn't know what to do, at first, but it seemed to me that it was best to leave them outside; maybe put a thank you on the door. It felt like more of a tribute to my Josie and my Anna if the flowers remained outside.[^22] if I wasn't exhausted I would have posted such a notice to the door. As it is, I am sitting here typing, because again, after the loss today, there is very little else I can do and feel that I have any semblance of control. Moreover, there will be a dropoff come Friday or Saturday.

It occurs to me that there is another reason to write this, and that's so that you, Rausch, read it. You have my wife and child, but that is all you have. You have not got my hope. You want me to write about impotence? You're about to find out just how untrue that is. The world is with me, Rausch. It's against you. You won't win.

[^21]: The *exact* nature of what has been happening—the nature of the ransom—has been kept an extreme secret kept between only Agents Cobb, Caravale and Detective Smythe. I suppose Rausch and I are keeping the secret, too.

[^22]: I want say, to you reader, it occurs me that I don't think I've typed there names down before now. I want you know that beyond Rausch's first instructions, and beyond letting you know the truth, I don't want their names smeared in this tripe. I don't want to discuss them, be reminded of them, write a memorial for them before they are gone. They are alive and out there and that is all that needs to be said. For this chapter and only this chapter I will mention their names because they were written over and over by those who cared and loved, and I'll be damned if I give Rausch satisfaction by saying them again in this screed.
