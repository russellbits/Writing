The bastard's critiquing me. I just got the email. I'll get to that.

I'm so pissed off. But that's beside the point. I should address what happened at the drop off. Yesterday afternoon, after I had got the gun, after I had practiced with it, I got the following series of text messages:

    Mon, Nov 3, 11:12am  
    Meet at the South side of the park nearest to your home.

    Mon, Nov 3, 11:14am  
    Sit on the bench next to the man in the Pea coat.  
    Give him the USB drive.

    Mon, Nov 3, 11:17am  
    He's a paid courier, Allen. Leave him alone.  
    I already know what you have planned.  
    He's innocent in all of this.

My heart sank when I read it. Without so much as one meeting having happened, already Rausch was ahead of me, damn it. I hadn't expected—hadn't even thought of the idea that he would use a courier. I know myself too well, and I couldn't hurt anyone innocent in this whole debacle. Even if they weren't "innocent," I wouldn't want to hurt anyone but Rausch. In fact, I nearly suspect Rasuch would like to see that—me going down some dark path and failing at his little game instead of finishing the work.

I went to the park, saw the man, and approached him. After sitting next to him, I spoke to the man in the pea coat. He had a hoody on underneath the wool coat and had his hood up with dark sunglasses on to boot. He had a scraggly beard, and judging by what little of his face I could see, he seemed old—even frail. When I spoke to him, he kept his face turned away from me. I asked him, "Why are you doing this?"

He said, "Do not make this complicated. Just give me the drive and we can both get out of here."

"Is he watching?"

"Probably. Yes! I do not know! Just let me go. Please."

I had the gun in my right hand and the USB drive in my left, both hands tucked in pockets, but it didn't matter. I could take this guy down without so much as a flinch. I had the bluster in that moment. The bully came out in me. But I let it subside. Why would Rausch hire some old man to get this drive unless he wanted me to lose my temper and attack him. Where would I be then? I beat up an old man? I sighed and pulled the USB out, still clutching to the textured, cold handle of the gun in my right hand. As I put the drive in the clammy hand of the man sitting next to me, I clutched his palm and said, "I just want to know who is doing this to us?"

There was a moment; I don't know what. It was like the man recognized my situation as his own. He turned to me for the first time, his head shadowed by his hood, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses, and he said, "We do what we are told. That is how we get out of this."

I let him go, still holding my finger on the trigger of the gun concealed in my pocket.

I let him walk away for about five minutes; until he was just out of view. And then I got up and followed.

I trailed him to the North end of the park that gave way to less dense parts of town where there were ways, unknown to me before, you could weave between business buildings and alleyways out of sight of anyone in the "normal" part of town. I never knew that anything or anyone could hide so plainly behind the faces of commerce. The stores face out and welcome all comers, while behind it all lurk men like the one I was following, and now men like me—men with guns.

I kept up with the man until we came into the forest. He was slow. Again, he seemed old. He was following no path and I am no tracker. At some point in the woods I wasn't sure that I was following him at all. He knew where he was going and I had no idea, no direction to tack. I stopped at a creek. There was a tree laid down across it and I contemplated balancing my way across but I'm out of shape and I just thought I would probably fall. And I already knew that the man with my words was far gone. Maybe he was further into the woods, maybe he was behind me, having doubled back. I had know idea. I had lost. You won this round, Rausch.

Exhausted and upset, I sat down on the tree and just stared at the water going down the creek, feeling like it was just seconds in my life draining out of me; feeling the incredibly heavy weight of how long it would again be until the next drop off and my next chance to turn the tables.[^10] Yes, Rausch, no matter what you say, you won't stop me from trying.

But in my moment of loss, it turned to reverie, maybe meditation. I just didn't feel like I was there anymore, and in that moment I discovered something utterly new to me at the age of fourty-three. I say my age because this was such a simple thing to discover, especially when I had spent my life slogging around creeks. In all that time, I never noticed this simple fact. A creek doesn't work like I thought. As I tried to balance myself on the log across the creek, I gripped another smaller sapling and when I did I shook a number of leaves down on to myself and down in to the creek. One of them was very obvious—it was a blood red leaf. In it, for a moment, I saw my heart. I expected to sit and watch it wash its way down the small waterfall near the log across the creek.

But that's not what happened. The leaf, it revolved. There was a pool in front of the log formed by a small waterfall. Then, there was another waterfall (we're talking one foot waterfalls here) and another small pool. The leave went *up* the creek towards the first waterfall. It was like the waterfall was sucking water into itself and dragging anything on the surface of the water back into it. the leaf went all the way around the circumference of the pool back the top waterfall and then went underneath and just vanished.

Mesmerized, I continued to watch and the leaf surface, maybe minutes, later. It popped back up in the middle of the pool. And then, after it had been submerged, it finally moved toward the second waterfall as I had expected it to do in the first place.[^11]

I had expected it to just wash down the creek. I never expected this circular period of time that had lapsed for not just the leaf, but for me as well. I just sat to catch my breath—maybe keep going after the man in the pea coat. But then, the lead went down the second waterfall and I watched as it, again, was submerged for minutes, appeared on the surface and then swirled around the pool back to the waterfall to be submerged again.

I wondered if it meant anything. Am I missing something? Is this whole matter closer to me than I think? If this whole torture is a creek, is there some mysterious way *up* the creek that I'm not considering?

I have to know who Rausch is. It doesn't even matter how he's torturing me. What kind of man does this? I need to know.

[^10]: And the tables *will* be turned. In about an hour I'm meeting with Detective Smythe and I plan to fill him in on the rest of the details. He'll no doubt be upset, but I can't imagine anyone being too upset with a man who is just trying to save his family the best way he knows how. I didn't ask him if he had a family; I will now. I don't care. He knows I'm operating under duress. I hope that gets me out of an obstruction charge or something else. Surely, his priority will be finding my family.

[^11]: Strange, is this reminiscent of the Reza Bahadir story about the gas chamber as well? Maybe it's just my imagination. Maybe it's just stress, my mind desperate to make connections where there are none. I fell like the lead and the whirlpool somehow indicate the relationship. It's like, the leaf is moved around on the surface of something it has no comprehension of and when it's finally whisked away, where it ends up is anything but linear. I'm probably reaching. It doesn't make me want to re-visit Reza Bahadir's stories though. Maybe there is one that is a better fit.
