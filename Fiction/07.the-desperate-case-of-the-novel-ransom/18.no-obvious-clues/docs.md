title: No Obvious Clues

On returning home, I found Cobb already there, returned from Athens. She was upset that I had ditched my detail and she asked about it. Exhausted from trudging out to  the school I told as much of truth as I could manage. I told her that I went into the woods to look for the courier and that it led me to the school. I searched the the place, but I found nothing of significance. She reminded me that the protection detail was there for my benefit, and that I wasn't to leave them again. I did not care. As far as I was concerned at that moment, Rausch had become some kind of force and there was no protection from It—police detail or not, there was no escaping Rausch, Its demands, or Its final plans, and I now strongly suspected that Its plan was to kill me when It had what It wanted—which even that I did not understand.

"Why the hell are you dressed like the Courier?"

"I thought... if the meeting place were the school then I thought that I could get Rausch into the open."

"You keep doing these idiotic things and there is no way you are going to see your wife and child again. Do you *seriously* want that, Allen?"

I looked to the floor. "I am doing anything that I possibly can do. There's no trace or slightest bit of evidence on this man who... has done what he's done. I *cannot* sit around and do nothing!—police detail or not."

"It's not no one, Allen. You were right."

Then Cobb told me that they had found Paul Nolan's farm and not much else. Judging from his mail, he hadn't been there in some weeks which gave them a good indication that Paul Nolan had something to do with the kidnapping. I told her that it wasn't Nolan, that I had been mistaken somehow. She asked how I knew. I said simply that something else was afoot. There was something I had left out of the Reza Bahadir story that was playing into this. Again, she asked me how I knew. I didn't answer. Puzzled, she looked at me, exhausted, and said, "What did you find, Worthington?"

I looked around the room for a lie. Exasperated I just spewed, "We need to try to catch Rausch again; a third time. I had time to think and it's not Nolan. It just doesn't make sense that it's Nolan."

"*You* said he knew you were writing as Reza. *You* said there were only four people who could know that. *You* said Nolan had a grudge or dislike of you. *You* said that. What's the deal, Worthington? We can't find Nolan—there's no trace of him fact. The closest witness I could find down there hadn't see him for weeks. He's missing. Your wife is missing. Your daughter is missing. This is looking very bad for *you*. Do you understand?"

"Nolan is a distraction. He's what Rausch *wants* us to go after. He's been so many steps ahead of us! Why would our first suspect be the right one? Paul's my old advisor; he's probably been pulled into this. He's... a bit of a prick... but this?"

Cobb said, "You went to the school. What did you find?"

"I found dreams. I found a decrepit building. I found something for myself, but nothing to do with this case."

"You know, Allen, I think you're lying. When I send some officers to the school tomorrow you will be better off when you tell me *right now* what they're going to find."

"I told you. They're going to find a decrepit building. I found something to write about there. What the hell am I supposed to write about, for Rausch, if I'm held up in my own home."

"And how, exactly, do you think Rausch will show up tomorrow?"

"I'll write. I'll write like it's been asking and it'll be what it wants."

"It?"

"Yes. It!"

I looked up at her, "Rausch will show. Rausch will show! I've got to write for it and it will demand the next drop off and we'll be there to get it—some part of it. The courier's not... a problem anymore." I winced.

Cobb leaned into me hard, "What the FUCK does that mean, Allen? What do you mean the courier is not a problem anymore?"

"I just... I don't think Rausch is really interested in the book. I think Rausch wants something else; something that I might write. The book doesn't have to hold together. There's... something else it wants. It wasn't Paul and I don't think Rausch is Paul and I don't think that it'll use the same courier anymore. It never needed a courier; that was all to throw us off. It was to threaten me. It just wants what I'm writing—not even that—something I might write. I don't know why!"

"That's bullshit, Allen! Rasuch doesn't need a courier? This is ridiculous. God damn it, Allen, how—" Cobb took a deep breath. She turned to Caravale and made a face that struck me as so demeaning, I can't describe it. "How could you possibly—you've damaged this investigation from the very beginning. You dodged a meeting with us and the local police; you went after the courier yourself. I'm putting you under house arrest and I want your cell phone." [^31]

I look at the palms of my hands. "They arrested K for much less that that."

"This isn't a god damned book, Allen!"

"It is for me! It is a book or some code or some password or some secret. I need to get those secret words into that drive that it keeps asking for. And worse than that, if I don't write the code it wants, my wife and child die!" I sit down, still staring at my palms. Cobb paces the living room. Caravale seats himself on the couch and covers his eyes, mumbling, "This is batshit insane."

"Why are you running around in the woods when the only ransom this guy has against you is you writing?" she says. "Have you written?"

I say, "Not much, but in the time we have I can get the requisite word count."

"What are we talking about?"

"Another 2000 words for the next drop off—Tuesday—if It doesn't change it's mind. I can write about dreams and other bullshit; it doesn't matter. I don't think that's what it's after."

"Write it. We'll take *our* second shot and *your* third shot." She paces the room in a square again and says, "I don't think you even begin to understand what's going on here."

"Fuck you. I've been trying since this began. I've done nothing but think about this since it started."

"No! I think you've become completely detached or unhinged. You keep talking to me about your wife and child and I just don't get it, Allen. You have the help of the Federal government on your side—the most impressive investigative agency you could possibly ask for, but when we go try to find your advisor—a major suspect—you suddenly claim it's not him! Your wife and child are missing and your are changing your story about who you think is at fault. There's no way. As far as I am concerned, you are Rausch. There's no way you aren't. You don't leave my sight for the next... however many days until we recover your wife and child. Then, you go away to prison for a long time."

She comes over to where I'm sitting and gets in my face. "You don't go anywhere until I know what you're doing. Hand over your phone."

Caravale grabs Cobb's shoulder, "Hey there. Slow down."

"Fuck this. He ditched our detail. He's guilty as shit," and with that she points in my face.

I say, "I just don't think my old English advisor kidnapped my family." I wait a beat, "Wherever he is, he's just not that crazy!"

"Then where is he?" shouts Cobb.

"I've no idea! It might not have anything to do with this! Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Maybe whoever it was threw you Paul Nolan as a patsy."

"What did you find at the school, Worthington?"

"I didn't find anything. There was nothing there."

Cobb turns to Caravale, "Search the school. Put units on it; scrub it. This asshole is lying." When she turns back to me, Cobb is livid (and I don't want her to be) "You're going to tell me why Rausch is anything but Paul Nolan. These things just don't sprout up from thin air," and she snaps her fingers in my face. "You'll tell me and in the meantime, you don't leave my line of sight for the next twenty-four hours. Drop off or no, you don't leave my sight. And I get Rausch's next message."

* * *

Early the next morning, in my office, I was informed that Cobb had received a series of messages on my phone.

`Mon, Nov 10, 6:27am  
We will meet tomorrow. If Reza Bahadir is not present,  
we will not accept the drive.`

`Mon, Nov 10, 6:29am  
We will deliver you the body of his child one hour later.`

`Mon, Nov 10, 6:32am  
You will make sure that Reza Bahadir has access to email  
throughout the day. That is all.`

[^30]: It helps a lot with writing if you are placed under house arrest. I didn't even know the FBI could do that, but here we are. They're searching the school right now and I have no idea what (if anything) they are going to find. I buried Paul in the woods and I don't think (hope) they're going to look there.
