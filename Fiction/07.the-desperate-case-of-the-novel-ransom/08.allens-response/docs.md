title: Subject: Just Shut Up, Rausch

I wrote this email to Rausch. Obviously it didn't get there—bounced back—

    Undeliverable: Just shut up Rausch  
    Delivery has failed to this recipient

I won't include this in the third drop off, but here it is anyway, for posterity:

`I wonder what would happen if you just accepted my work and shut the hell up with your musings about what it could or should be? I wonder if it would be even possible for you to do that? Who the hell are you to make these pronouncements, Rausch? I want to know what you've written. Anything? I wonder what work of art *isn't* happening here because of your arrogant interference? I will grant that your "exercise" has given me new confidence to write more than I have before; I'd no idea I could write so much in so little time. It's not worth the price, but it has occurred. But what I'm certain of is that what I'm writing now is not what I would be writing otherwise.`

`I'm not allowed to directly quote your ransom note? I have to paraphrase it? How about this: shove your ransom note where the sun doesn't shine, Rausch. Why would I dignify your batshit insane scribblings with any kind of public acknowledgement. You're like the psychopath killer who demands that his editorial be published by some newspaper. You haven't the talent to get your own work out into the world. That's why you're using me. You want me to talk about impotence? You're the dictionary definition of it. Kidnapping a man's wife and child to make him write, to try to bend him to your will? *That's* impotence.`
