title: The House of Doubt
---

I drink the awful concoction that Ezra has forced on me and wait for its effects to begin. I can only guess at what I'm consuming. But before Ezra has satisfied himself that I have drank his poison and begins to leave, I say, "You don't know enough about myth or history to know what you're doing here."

"How's that? Enlighten me."

"The man who forces another man to drink the poison is never the man who becomes immortal." I smile.

He scoffs. "We'll see."

It's ten, fifteen, twenty minutes(?) or so before I become nauseous. There's a wastepaper can by the desk and I dry-heave in that. It's, again, I don't know how many more minutes before I stop dry heaving and the blood pressure in my head returns normal and I wonder if I can lift my head away from the can. But I keep staring into and the formations of paper in the bottom of it. It crosses my mind that the trash can is just a receptacle and that a receptacle is just one thing that can hold another thing. I pick the trash can up and, still staring into its ever-growing depth and darkness, I sit back on my butt and then push/scoot myself backwards until I'm leaning against the wall, the trash can perched between my knees. The paper in the bottom is bothering me. It is crumpled. The edges of the paper have more edges and those edges have edges, like a fractal. Then I can see that the trash can is not dark at all but all varying shades of dark and that the paper and its edges are varying shades of dark, and that the edges on the edges all vary, and that the edges of those edges vary, until the very idea of paper has left my mind entirely and all I can see are vibrating triangles of dark colors and contrasting tiny triangles of shadows working their way into and out of one another. The boundaries to all the crumpled pieces of paper emerge as one piece of paper and none of it crumpled at all, but just varying physical facets of some idea of paper. It was not paper at all that I was seeing and I could no longer resist the urge to reach down into the can—far down into the can—to just gingerly touch the edge of the object in the bottom of the can. It is coarse; far more so than its colors belie. I giggle (audibly or not I don't know). I grab one of these flowers—these Chrysanthemums—of brightly lit triangles and gingerly remove it from the can only to receive an incredible shock.

Once removed from the can, the flower I had gently plucked becomes rock hard and coarse again in the harsh, bright light of the rest of the room. The shadows of the can had made my eyes dilate; I'd jammed my head into the can, and when I look at the paper, I have to drop it and cover my eyes. I stay with my eyes closed for a long time and watch red paramecium swim about on the surface of my eyelids. I mumble, "Just checking my eyelids for leaks..." My eyes open slowly and they only open from a spotted darkness, not dreams. The room is a void. At one and the same time, it is filled with items, but all the items are just a piece of one item, all twisted and attached. I let out a long breath trying to calm myself. It only lasts a moment as I hear someone outside my door say, "Do you know the answer if anyone hears it?" I think I mumble, "Oh God," but it comes out of my mouth as, "Saya gouda." I think it does. I try to convince myself that I'm not hearing anyone at all. I stare up at the ceiling. It is breathing. It is swelling. Light is coming into the room. It is either dawn or dusk or the lights are on; I do not know because suddenly all I can see is the ceiling and while it is not lit, it is bright. I try to breathe with the ceiling. I try to catch my breath. I hadn't realized I was out of breath. I breath deep again. The ceiling is... is not breathing, but interacting patterns. The squares in the tile in the ceiling are spinning into one another, their corners making new shapes, triangles breathing pentagons breathing dodecagons, and they are all sparkling. I shut my eyes for a moment. Without thinking about it at all, I profess, "There is nothing in the middle time!"

And then the voice outside the door says, "Before the tendrils, where were all the minds piled?"

"Nope." I say out loud. This time I'm sure I speak out loud (or unusually loud) because my voice comes back at me from the space with a vengeance. I moan. I put the trash can down. I crawl away from the desk. The voice outside the room says something but I can't make it out. I'm too busy concentrating on getting to my hands and knees. "Nope," I say again, with the room chiming in with a merry chorus of reverb. I'm on my hands and knees and see that the floorboards look like a toy from my childhood: my magic color disc. The little plastic disc would be some swirl of colors, and then you could press the back of it and the colors would bend and spread and swirl out in tendrils, and the floor was just like that underneath me with all the beautiful colors of white and yellow and beige and red in the cherry wood. I push down on the floor and the grains of the wood shove out from underneath my hand making ripples and waves and swirls. I look down under my stomach to my knees and they are very far away. The colors are also upside down and clinging to the floor, which is the ceiling now, I realize. I push my knees into the wood and again the wood grain flows around the pressure in curves, now even more vivid that before, like dropping food coloring in water.

The voices outside the room say, "Soup cans are hell on your ears."

Another voice replies, "You got that right."

I turn my head right side up again, but now the whole room is upside down and so I try to get down on my stomach. It feels like I'll stick better that way. I am sticking, I realize. *I am definitely sticking to the ceiling*, I think with confidence. *I'm in good shape. I'm definitely sticking.* I begin seal-crawling over to the bed, which is also now inexplicably stuck to the ceiling, and as I do I realize that the bed has a large gap underneath it. *Genius! Right now! If I crawl into the gap, I'll be safer on the ceiling since if I fall off the ceiling, the bottom of the bed will catch me, no problem.*

It's dark underneath the bed, which is welcome considering the twilight, and there is a humming coming from the far corner. Even so, it is quiet between the bed and the ceiling and also the ceiling is moving much less now that I am in the shadows. I test the theory by saying, "Nope," and sure enough, this time, the room doesn't yell back at me. "Thanks, room," I say, trying to fool the room, but the room isn't fooled and still doesn't yell back. I sigh, given the quiet and then think to myself, *I should've brought one of the books down here with me.* That thought is quickly followed by, *I can't get back down to the desk right now, so it doesn't matter. I'll have to think without the books.* I zone out for a moment, trying to have a thought, but none will come to me because the humming in the corner of the bed is getting louder. I listen to it. It's air. It's air that has music in it. It's a ventilation shaft and there's music coming from another room, just barely audible over the sound of the air. I still myself further and shut my eyes and listen to the noise coming from the vent. It's strings. It's stringed-instruments and someone is talking-singing with them. I listen more. They're singing-speaking—like a Gregorian chant: "What was before the tendrils that watch the minds?"

*Trees* I think and then listen more.

Again, the chant is too low to hear for a moment until it rises above the strings in a reverse whirlpool of sound that chants, "The sound of the tree's fall in dominum ae us." It's Latin. I don't Latin. *Trees don't make sound. There is always evidence of sound for later information.*

These were all things that Reza said. I try to picture Reza saying it, but it's just me, but it's not me. Then, I see Rebecca's face in the dark and I can see that Rebecca's face is many faces. Her face is her face until I remember it differently and then it is my friend Marnie's face and then it is a famous starlet's face, and then it is Rebecca's face again, only now I can see all the faces at once. It was Rebecca in the dream, but I did not know Rebecca then. I am sure of it.

I realize I've forgotten about the chant! I concentrate but it's gone away now. There is only the sound of air traveling through the shafts, rising in pitch until I can hear the strings again. Then the chanting one more time, "Resus but nothing occurs without witness."

*What are these idiots singing about?* I think to myself. I look out from under the bed and realize that I am under the bed. I'm not *above* the bed, I'm *under* the bed. This revelation occurs to me with the joyous excitement of discovering some new theory of gravity. [^35] I feel a sudden purpose: to see if I can stand again. I drag myself out from under the bed and stand up. It is tough but I manage to do it without concerning myself too much with the way that the wood floors are allowing my feet to sink into them a little more than I am comfortable with. I simply decide not to look at my feet. And then, I think, *I must look at my feet*. I always look at my feet. So I do so, and the longer I stare at them and the way the wood grain is stretching around them like a trampoline, the further they get from me. *A second test. I need a second test.* I look around the room and sitting on the desk, I see the dreamer's journals. I practically fall over trying to reach them from across the room, catching myself on the corner of the bed. I tread more carefully, unfortunately looking at my feet as I do. The expanse between me and my feet gives me vertigo and I fall to my knees with a loud thump, the heavy noise betraying the rubber nature of the floor. There is a loud bang outside the room, and shouting. I shuffle on my knees to the desk and grab one of the journals in my right hand. As I do, I knock a receptacle on to the floor and it bounces near my knees. In a moment of rage against this twisted world where a thing is disconnected to the everything it is, I pick it up, squeeze it and feel porcelain and throw it as hard as I can against a wall. It shatters, surprisingly. I lose myself for a moment in the noise; I revere in it. The thing, it is broken. It is many. I am entropy. I am entropy! I look to the ceiling and see the many shapes that make and I will them to break apart and they do. They fall apart into the ceiling. I turn to the book in my right hand. I open it. I scan one page after another looking for words but it's all gibberish. It's worse than gibberish; the words on the page are barely that, just series of swirling squiggles.

A loud bang comes from outside the bedroom door and someone shouts, "Actuaries!"

Without so much of a thought I slam my hand into the top half of the journals on the desk out into the air and laugh out loud as I watch them bend and fly around the air currents in the room that right now I can see as a distinct blue. I shout, "Writing is for naught!" The journals fall to the floor at the sound of my voice. So, I repeat it, "Writing is all for naught." And I laugh this time when the room shouts back.

I put it out of my mind and turn to the book again and this time turn to a page that has a drawing like this:

![An image of a maze that resembles my dream](images/the-monster-diagram.png "The Monster in the House of Doubt")

And I see it now. The dreamers. The classrooms. It was all beneath. They went in paths and did not go down, did not look at their feet.

Something grabs my shoulder and I turn in shock and fear. I put my hands up.

A face I know; my own face but not my face. I am peering over myself and saying, "The dreamers?"

I say to myself, staring up at myself. "The dreamers must awaken."

I am picking myself up off the ground saying, "Ok, ok. We've got to get down there."

I let myself put my arm around my own shoulder and I walk, while decidedly not looking at my feet, and try to trudge along, baring some of my weight on my other self. It is a younger self; my muscles are more... powerful and thicker some time ago. My younger self asks me, "What will happen when you wake them?"

"They will be wraiths. They will be lost."

For moments, I am just dragging myself down a spiraling hallway, falling down hard stairs as loud sounds and a crying out echoes around me—more shouts of "Free the actuaries!" But I could barely hear the cries for I simply was not was, clearly split between the me-now and the me-slightly-ahead. My mind goes for a moment to Reza speaking to me, a long time ago about the was that is not. I asked him, "What was before the tendrils that watch the minds?"

I wake up in another deep breath. It is Reza, not me, carrying me down the hallway, down the stairs, around bends. There are people all about, scurrying. Reza says, "What?"

"Of course," I say, "My face is your face. Rebecca's face is Marnie's face is... is what's her name?"

Reza-of-just-ahead asks, "Who?"

"The actress."

Reza, calm, seated, bearded, looks at me and smiles from a long time ago. "If a tree falls in a forest does anyone hear it? Do you know the answer?"

The Reza-of-just-ahead says, "What are you talking about, Reza? Tell me."

"The faces are all the same. The faces are the faces that you need to understand. The face in the fear, the face in the knowledge, the face in the calm. I only know that the tree falls... I only know the tree falls, because I can find it later, fallen."

"I'll bite. You can find the tree. Did it make a sound?"

"No. Information. The faces, the tree, they are all gone; only information remains. Information is the cause."

The Reza that is carrying me, the Reza-just-ahead says something I cannot understand.

"Without evidence of my senses I cannot know. Knowing without being is the dream. It's the replay, always."

Reza-just-ahead has brought me back to the chamber of the sleepers. By each one of their bedsides I see their empty and shadowy apparitions—their wraiths—their wretched, lost souls. Their knowing is trapped in a place of knowing without being and their being is trapped in a place of being without knowing. I begin to cry. Poor shadows...

I shout at the wraiths, "Be, wraiths! Cut down those who have cut you from your tendril! I am Reza Bahadir!—they have cut you from your silver tendril! Steal from them what they have stolen from you!"

The Reza-who-carries-me screams in anguish and we both drop to our knees. The wraiths have heard *my* command—the-Reza-Now—and like screaming, clawed, disembodied, shredded torture they attack, swirling like smoke around those who are not the sleepers. There is screaming all around me. I crawl on the floor, thankful for the concrete that supports me and doesn't threaten to swallow me and make my way to each sleeper. In my hand, I find a sharp piece of a broken coffee mug—I am bleeding too—and with it I shred the silver cord of the sleepers trapped in a nightmare.

*All I ask is what exists in the middle time? It fell, you did not hear it; later, you found it fallen. Only then, did you know, yes?*

I free all the sleepers. I crawl from bed to bed and even as I do, they grow more angry. The catastrophe of noise rises to a chorus of screams. I realize that the wraiths have not only obeyed me, but have attacked me as well. They swirl around me with howls like banshees. The whole left side of my body burns. I crawl to a set of stairs and try to make my way away. The wraiths have become so enraged that they are simply filling the whole of Horimizad up with their foul stench and anger. I go one stair at  a time, but the staircase is long; so long.

*Nothing before the knowing has ever existed. The knowing without being is a nothing; one you will arrive at.*

Then, I feel like I can't breathe and I myself, like the sleeper-wraiths fall into a dream.

* * *

A calm voice says, "Although it is decided, nothing occurs without witness," and I am inside of a staircase that cannot end. Reza-of-long-ago whispers, "There is always the invisible progress. That is not why this Universe exists."

Ezra sits on the stair in front of me—the one I don't have enough coordination to reach. I cannot reach the next stair. My arm simply will not obey me. I suck in another deep breath and try to move my body. It is like a car is on the embankment, and no amount of thrust or anger or rage or effort will move it. I try them all. Ezra says through cruel teeth, "The waking dream is upon you, too." I try to thank him for his arrogance. I can't speak. My tongue won't even move. What he has released is so foolish, and all in the name of an immortality desired by simple children of the mind. He's no idea the power he's released in the wraiths. They will not stop. They are everywhere. I look around the staircase and not only does it go up forever, it is barely wide enough to support me. On either side of me is a void far darker than the black that the wraiths wear.

I try to move up the staircase but again my body is totally failing me. I cannot move one step. I lie down, uncomfortably, across the steps. The wraiths come close to me; swishing past me in paths with angry and saliva-drenched hisses. I look for my feet. They are not there. I am hanging on to the staircase with desperation. I know that I am hanging on to the staircase. There is nothing beneath my vision that I am looking from. Nothing. No stairs. No me. But I am hanging on to something. I am hanging on to the last pedestal.

Hanging. I have hung on to so many things. Trees. I hang on trees. I have always hung on trees. I see trees from my childhood; round sturdy oaks and I swing from the limbs. Then there is a staircase of tree branches in a deciduous forest— rhododendrons—and I know I am near the top of the hill. Rhododendrons near a waterfall that I can hear. I can here the song. I know it is the end of the climb. There is water and mist and cool air and a rush of noise in the distance. In those trees I can see a thousand leaves overlapping one another, the sun shining through each. Where each leaf overlaps one another, there are another thousand leaves. Within each leaf is a set of another one thousand leaves, and within each one of them are another thousand leaves. I try to see one leaf, but all I can see are the leaves inside the leaves and between them, blinding light. I begin to draw into the thousandth of the child of the thousandth leaf when I hear Josie's voice: "I know we're not on the right trail, but this is all they have given me, Allen, a pen and paper." Her sentence echoes over and over in my mind. And it's harder and harder to get away from because of the way the trees are setting off red lights. There are constant flashes of red lights and no matter where I look I can't find Josie and the yellow light of the sun bends to red. I have gone off the trail, and I lost her. I keep trying to look but everywhere the rhododendron is confused by these stupid flashing red lights.

"This is all they have given me: a pen and paper." I distract myself from the dawn of light itself and it's one thousand fractals of the leaf in order to look at my desk. There is the typewriter? There is a stack of papers. There is a stack of papers on my desk and I am not at all sure if they are mine. Are they Mine? Are they Reza's? I stumble-step towards the desk needing to know what is this stack of papers.

I feel an arm across my shoulders. It is different from Reza's. It is not a young, muscular Reza-ahead-of me. It's tender. I know it. It's Josie.

[^35]: Which, when you think about it, I did shift from a pretty poor theory to a better one.
