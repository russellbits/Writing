`Subject: How exciting`  

`Allen,`

`Well, that was exciting was it not?—a big exciting chase and all? Certainly you should write about every detail of the way that I bested you and the FBI. I expected you to get to the police involved at some point, but I have to admit you took action sooner that I thought you would. Still, even with the help of the FBI, you accomplished nothing. And, you did so at great risk, don't you think? After all, I have your wife *and* child. In fact, I think it is worth pointing out that in order for our engagement to continue, I only really need one of them. One too many more moves off the chess board like that and I might just have to prematurely end our engagement.`

`You know, I really hate making threats, Allen. Just wite the damn original story and I will return them safe and sound. They are quite comfortable, you know. I am not a malicious person. I just want to see you discover something genuine. I know you know the beginning. You sit around and tear apart the work of all these other writers, but you really have no idea what it is to do what they do—to pour yourself into something that is devastatingly close to your true self, your worldview, your heart. It is, in some sense, the ultimate religious experience. It's unfair that you have it and I do not.`

`And let's talk about that, too. You are right, after all. I have to admit it. How in the world could I expect you to write the original story if I have restrained you from telling the truth? So, here are some adjustments to our original conditions:`

`1. I told you, under no circumstance to contact the authorities. Obviously, after yesterday, you did. I cannot say that I am surprised. The truth is, I put that condition in there just to keep you at bay for as long as I could. I mistakenly thought that keeping you away from the authorities might cause some introspection. It did, somewhat. I mean, "paraphrasing" Reza Bahadir was mildly inspired, although I think you and I know both who that really is.`[^17]

`All these children's stories you have in your head. I suppose they're fine when they apply to the context of your life, but really, how droll. They are not what I am looking for here. For all their value, fables do not contain earnestness. I would just appreciate it if you would try to explore the feeling of helplessness you are feeling right now a bit more. That would be earnest. After our last encounter, that must be what you are feeling. I am confident the authorities will do no better job than you of ever finding out who I am, so you will have to keep writing, and why not explore your impotence? I feel too few works of literature really explore that feeling.`

`2. I do want you writing about the truth, but it's not your Truth that I want. You are right in the respect that being able to explore the truth of your feelings, and what you are potentially losing has become awkward in your writing. I hate the ellipses describing that which you cannot describe in anything but literal terms. Let us stop with that nonsense. So, you are free of the condition that initially said that you could not speak about the fact that I have kidnapped your wife and daughter. Incidentally (and this is something to think about) you are also now free to write about them and why you love them. Just a suggestion. I imagine you could mine those feelings for quite a lot of words, but do know that I am not at all interested in those particular words. Wax poetic as you like about your family, but you and I know that this is much larger than that.`

`I feel the need to explain why I originally did not want you to explore this portion of the story. Simply put, I want the original story extracted from you. The beginning of the beginning. I know it's in you, and in order to get it I put your heart on the line. But I have underestimated the entanglement that love is. Pardon the prepositional faux pas; call it artistic license—something you should take more of. (Did it again :) Write about your wife and child if they really mean something to you. But your autobiography is not important to me. Tell the original story.`

`3. Regarding the original 'ransom packet' as you have come to call it: I assume you have turned it over to the police and the FBI. I wonder where they were at the first drop off though... did you lie to them? Did your gun make you a tad overconfident? It will be curious to see what they make of that. You know they could arrest you for obstruction of justice? I suppose they will not—in fact, I counted on it.`[^18] `But at any rate, I will relax the original concession that you could not talk about the ransom and the demands on one condition: you may paraphrase anything that I wrote. You may not print the packet in its full. You may not take quotes from my writing verbatim. You may only paraphrase the packet.`

`I suppose the FBI is already quite busy with analyzing it in numerous ways; let's not let the artistry of our writing stoop to their silly attempts at profiling. We also both know that kind of science is bullshit.`[^19]

`Finally, the number 50,000, when spelled out, should be hyphenated, as in 'fifty-thousand.' Oh no. Look who just lost a number of words. (Maybe you shouldn't repeat yourself so much.)`

`I will text you on Friday, Allen—or maybe it will be Saturday. You should keep writing, but I think my plan calls for a bit of variability now.`

[^17]: Bingo. Thank you agent Cobb! Reza Bahadir was a plant. There's no such author, and there is only one sick, sick man in the world who would know the name and use it to get a one-up on me. Gotcha', Rausch.

[^18]: Total lie. There's no way he could know the role of that dice. For at least a day or two, I know I was Agent Cobb's number one suspect. The only three things that I think changed her mind were my desperation, the madness of the claim itself, and everything that I had written up until Tuesday. Even if you were making an insane claim about fulfilling some crazy ransom after you had maybe killed your wife and child, would you really follow through? I don't know what she found in those first few sessions of writing that changed her mind, but something did. Then, after the second botched drop off, I think she knew with even greater confidence that I wasn't in on this. I couldn't have been at the computer cafe to receive the drone and if I had made plans that had so many wheels in motion, something would have had to give. In the car, before the drop off, she could see how scared I was.

[^19]: This means something, but I have no idea what. If Rausch is who I think he is, I don't recall ever talking about FBI profiling as a science, or whether it was any good or not.
