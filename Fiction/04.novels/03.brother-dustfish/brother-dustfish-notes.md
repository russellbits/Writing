Brother Dustfish Notes

Able is to replace Gabriel on the council of the Masters of Mistakes. Gabriel left the world to find the real world. When he left, the council could not hold the world together. Able, like Gabriel, has the ability to introduce purpose into the code.

# Ideas for Later:

+ Wacamolo tells a story about bees and one bee who thought he had free will.

+ What is Gef's story?

+ The villain of this story did what he did out of love; he didn't mean for the destruction to happen. But so long as its happened, he sees it as progress.

+ Po eats the Texo Compass

+ Evo was a member of the council.

+ Ghendra was Evo's student.

+ The crew meets a thing like Nip but massive and dangerous.

+ The crew has to make their way through a jungle of junk.

+ ~~Rilla and Wacamolo show up with Arthra and stuff at the entrance to the city of Horn.~~

+ Nip becomes a swarm. Arthra learns to fly (by walking on copies of Nip).

+ Baron Leocadia sends bounty hunters after the crew.

+ A con man joins the group

+ The crew acquires a fighter of some kind. Do they free a mechanoman?

+ Who are the members of the Council?
	+ Evo
	+ Vivian
	+ Gabriel
	+ Kiokesuimas
	+ ?

# Backstory

# Other Notes

1. Apply Dan Harmon's story circle or the other older mythology building tools to Able

What is the Story Circle?
1. A character you can identify with
2. The character has a wish or need that is unfulfilled
3. The need or wish causes them to cross a threshold
4. They go down a road of trials
5. They are searching for something and find it (like it or not)
6. That discovery kicks their ass
7. They come back to the world they started in having gone through trials
8. Having changed

Meanwhile, Hero of 1000 faces:
1. Call to Adventure
	Sometimes it is given by a mythical animal
2. 

1. Able has the ability to create the mistakes, but they are also his call to adventure. They urge him an push him to places. They are the mythical animal—also, they are the CODE.

Understanding, or at least manipulating the CODE is the unrealized boon!
