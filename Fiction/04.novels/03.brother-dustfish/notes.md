# Brother Dustfish Notes

Able is to replace Gabriel on the council of the Masters of Mistakes. Gabriel left the world to find the real one. Gabriel imagined a way to remove energy from the real world to siphon it into the Shattered Land (which used to be Warnel). Unfortunately, Gabriel's plan went sideways and .

## The species of the Shattered World
+ Nomex - The nomex are the most common sentient creatures in the world. However, they range in color and appearance. The nomex of the Idex Mortez tend to be dark skinned with dark hair, while the nomex of Boisneval, for instance, are tall and very thin and have very light-colored skin, pinkish to blonde to gray hair and bright blue eyes.
+ Synthoids - An ancient race of machine people, synthoid beings were constructed tens of thousands of years ago. Though synthoids possess the ability to construct others of their own kind, how synthoids function is lost to time. 
+ Myconoids - Underground dwellers, the Myconoids, without their biome, are very tall (2 meters) and very thin and haveno eyes. They grow lichen and mushrooms on themselves (referred to as their biome) for sustenance and protection.
+ Dustmyn - Similar in size and shape to nomex, the dustmyn live on and around the Silt Sea, their capital city being Hasnasfresis, a city built on the back of a giant, ancient (long dead) silt tortoise. They are small in stature (~1 meter) and grow their hair in long, thick bushels that collect silt, protecting them both from the sun and wind on the Silt Sea. Their hair is generally brown or blonde and their eyes usually gold, but they are rarely seen without significant amounts of obscuring clothing such as goggles. They are quiet and fierce.
+ Cimexapods - Large mantis-like insect people who live East of the Inverted Mountain. They generally stay in their territory, but in recent times, for some reason, they have been encroaching on other lands.

# The Council
## Enki
The scientist responsible for the Shattering. He believed that there was a way to extract energy from another dimension that would allow Obtala--the lower lands--to exist forever. The Gods of old, who had said not to test the code, were wrong in the eyes of Enki. Instead, his experiment backfired and the world of Obtala and Obthalis and Obkhan began to be sucked into the void at the center of the Inverted Mountain—the home base and laboratory of Enki.
## Vivian
The wife of Enki and scientist in her own right. She did not entirely believe in Enki's ideas, but then there was an obvious need to create a power for the world to keep it at its status quo. Vivian supported Gabriel's experiments but at times was terrified by the lengths he would go to channel into the next world; a place she knew was forbidden because of the programming of the nanosphere she had seen.
## Evo
Evo did not believe in maintaining the status quo. Eva already felt that the world was unbalanced and the only balance to be found would be in the mysteries of what the world made of itself.

She felt that a return to the natural state of the world was what must be done; though she understood that much had changed since the beginning of it. Civilizations should turn to reducing their need for power and instead compact it in the simple nature of the face that the Gods were not Gods; rather architects of rules—unapologetic artists. The Gods clearly left their artifacts behind. She engineered much of the Gods technology in order to create the Idex Automata.

## Nyn
On the side of Evo, Nyn also felt that the world would not 

## Kiokesuimas
A myconoid. He disappeared not long after the Shattering.

## Horr'off

# Ideas for Later:

+ Wacamolo tells a story about bees and one bee who thought he had free will.

+ What is Gef's story? What is Gef was Gabriel's assistant? Is that what he chose to forget?

+ The villain of this story did what he did out of love; he didn't mean for the destruction to happen. But so long as its happened, he sees it as progress. We now know that he did it to find some infinite energy source.

+ ~~Po eats the Texo Compass~~

+ Evo was a member of the council. She alone among scientists of the council re-discovered the ability to create synthoids. She created a child synthoid in the hopes of creating a true form of optimism and balance and sustainability in opposition to Gabriel's ideas of constant growth.

+ Ghendra was Evo's student.

+ ~~The crew meets a thing like Nip but massive and dangerous.~~ The crew meets something like the mistakes in the Automatic Jungle.

+ ~~The crew has to make their way through a jungle of nanotechnology that tries to transform them.~~

+ ~~Rilla and Wacamolo show up with Arthra and stuff at the entrance to the city of Horn.~~

+ Nip becomes a swarm. Arthra learns to fly (by walking on copies of Nip).

+ Baron Leocadia sends bounty hunters after the crew.

+ A con man joins the group

+ The crew acquires a fighter of some kind. Do they free a mechanoman?

# Backstory

# The Story Circle

1. A character you can identify with
2. The character has a wish or need that is unfulfilled
3. The need or wish causes them to cross a threshold
4. They go down a road of trials
5. They are searching for something and find it (like it or not)
6. That discovery kicks their ass
7. They come back to the world they started in having gone through trials
8. Having changed


Understanding, or at least manipulating the CODE is the unrealized boon!
