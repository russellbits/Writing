# Chapter 15

## In which Vivian meets Able

Vivian made everyone go to rooms she had made for them. Able was unexpected. Vivian had seen the future, seen this rabble coming. Not Able. She calmly sat herself in a large chair in a tower with a window that looked out over even the Idex Mortez it was so high. "You will obey me." She said to Able.

"Okay! What would you like?"

"No! Obey me!"

"Let my friends go."

"NO!"

"Okay."

"What are you?"

"I don't know. I've been told many things. Some people tell me I'm a child. Some people tell me I'm an abomination. Some people tell me—"

"Enough!" Vivian leaned toward Able from her chair, "Obey me."

Able smiled.

"OBEY ME."

Able smiled.

"What is... what are you made of?"

"I don't know."

"You must obey me."

"I don't think so. Sorry."

"You were made. Who made you?"

"Evo."

"What!?" screamed Vivian. She sat up straight in her chair and light poured out of her body, up into the giant chamber that Able couldn't actually remember coming to. One moment they were in the city and the next they were here.

"Evo was my mother."

"You virulent garbage nonsense—how dare you!?"

"I dare what?"

"How dare you name a member of the council, you insolent wretch."

"Council?"

"The council! THE council!"

"I don't know."

"Evo! You knew Evo!"

"She was my mother."

"Evo was not your mother, you little wretch."

"Um, she used to tell me that I could see colors where no one else could."

"Evo told you that?"

"She also gave me some cubes that I used to make some of my friends."

"You cannot be a creation of Evo!"

"Well, that's fine. If I'm not and you're sure, will you let me and my friends go?"
