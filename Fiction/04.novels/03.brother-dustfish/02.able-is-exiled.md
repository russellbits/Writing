# Chapter 2

## In which  meet Able and learn of his simple existence in the Shattered Land.

Able dumped an armload of tablets onto the conveyor belt. He watched as the stone relics rumbled down the brundlex that crushed them into chunks and powder, sad that he will never know what they might have said. Suddenly, painfully, he’s awakened from his brief reverie by his brother slamming a cart into his back. “Get moving, clockworks.” Able steps aside to let his big brother lift the cart’s contents on to the conveyor belt. He bent down and rubbed the backs of his ankles. His father approached with another cart, shouted out to Able, “If you don’t keep moving in this world, son, it will cause you nothing but pain.”

Rubbing his nose, Able walked away from his father and brother off toward one of the mesa’s legs. He climbed a high pile of tablets to the top and looked south to see if he could see any of the dust clouds kicked up by the traders and their centipedes. This day he saw nothing. Later, after many more armfuls of tablets had been crushed and churned and broken, Able and his brother and father loaded a large cart with the blackrock. This cart is as tall as Jedediah and requires both Able’s brother and his father to pull it down a long trail to a station where they pile the blackrock in the hopes that traders will come and leave grain or jerky or cloth or wood in trade. Able’s father and brother will be gone for several hours on this trip to the station and it is, by far, the best part of the day.

As Jedediah and Able’s brother are preparing to leave with the big cart, Able—without knowing why—says, “Father, I think I could make a brundlex that would pull the cart for you, if you like.”

Jedediah turned to Able, silhouetted against the low gray sky. He removed his large-brimmed black hat and wiped his brow. “No.” Able was not sure what to make of the reply. He stood dutifully waiting to be dismissed, looking up at his father, whose eyes were so wrinkled and frowning that Able could barely see his pupils. “We do that for your mother because she is *ill*. We men, and you, have our health and it is ungodly to use your—“ Able’s father searched for the word, “—your curse when we have our health and can do this work ourselves.”

After a moment, Able’s father squatted down to Able's level and said, with more patience, “The Ungod forsook this world because men were lazy. Whatever your creations are, Able, you must not use them idly. You should not use them at all... unless you must.” Able’s father put his heavy, almost stony hand on Able’s shoulder. “You can still be an ungodly man, my son, but to do so you must be humble about what you make.” Able looked to the ground and thought about the mistakes in his room, hiding beneath his cot.

After his father and brother had left, and after he had checked on his mother, Able sat on the floor among his mistakes. For weeks now, after a feeding, Nip flew about the room. And now, for the last few days, Nip had taken to flying up next to a small window, high in the room. Nip would sit at the window, bumping against the glass, making a light tapping noise. Able, stared up at Nip said, “There’s no where to go, Nip.”

Nip flew several times from the window to Able, but when Able tried to hold the flying mistake, Nip whisked off back to the glass. Finally, Nip did what it did the first time, hovering in place and quivering, its light growing brighter and brighter. The light became so bright that even little Po came out from behind Able to look. (Ka was paying no attention whatsoever to his sibling’s seeming tantrum.) And, with a flash, Nip had sparked a third, new halo, and in a fury, Nip glowed bright green and shot through the window.

Able’s eyes grew wide in horror. “No, no, no, Nip! Nip!” He jumped up and ran to the wall. The window was too high for him to reach. He strained to see if he could make out the mistake anywhere in the sky. It was bad enough if his father saw the broken window, but more than that, Able’s heart was broken. His mistake had left him.

* * *

The broken window was blamed on an errant rock falling off the mesa. Able escaped punishment, which usually consisted of Jedidiah having him break something he loved—it hardly mattered what, with Jedediah knowing so little about Able. Able looked for Nip for days and could find it nowhere. In the mornings, when collecting tablets for his father, Able would circle all the way around the mesa, looking constantly for his little green buzzing mistake. Every night, when the sun set, even though it was dangerous, he snuck outside hoping that the low light would be enough to let him see even a faint green glow. He did not stay out long; the desert was dangerous at night, he knew. Still, he couldn’t help himself.

One day, after his father and brother had hauled the big cart away, he open the tablet-crushing brundlex and emptied the electrol to feed Po and Ka. Without Nip there to take his share, both Po and Ka had grown in size. Po was still the smallest but Ka had grown very big—so much so he was about the size of Able’s head.

When Able went to feed them, he was ecstatic to open his sack and see that there were once again three mistakes. Po and Ka were there, and now Nip was there, too!—at least he thought it was Nip. The little mistake was half the size of Ka, but no longer a sphere. It had grown a permanent ring around itself and there were spires growing out of its center.

He knew it was Nip because no sooner were the three mistakes out of the bag then Nip and Ka were at it as usual, bumping each other. Nip rolled inside its new ring but it wasn’t long at all before its three halos appeared and it was off the ground hovering. Nip rushed by Able’s face a few times, even faster than it had been when it had left before. It hovered in front of Able and Able gently put out his hands to hold it. Nip allowed him to do so, but then after a few minutes it began to tug on Able, tugging until Able stood up, and then tugging again to move Able to the wall with the window.

Able found that he could grasp the new ring that Nip had grown, using it like handles. Once he did this, Nip lifted him up off the ground, hauling him up to the window. Able scrambled to get his legs up on the sill and when he did, Nip made the strangest cheering tweet and shattered the window. “Wow, Nip. Neat!”

Once more Able grasped the ring around Nip and the little mistake carried Able off the ground and away into the air. Able gasped and tightened his grip as Nip whisked him far above the cabin, around and above the great spiny legs of the dead mesa and then with a loud triumphant chirp, hauled Able all the way up to the top of the mesa where it set him down gently.

Able was ecstatic now, containing himself only just, as he stood on top of the mesa and looked all around at the yellow afternoon sky. He could see so far he didn’t even know what he was looking at. The piles and piles of tablets blended into a beautiful landscape of valleys and paths. To the east he thought he could make out a giant horn of some kind—a horn with more horns—but it was far away and hazy on the horizon. There was something more strange and closer than the canyon. A small plume of smoke rose from what appeared to be a giant beetle with its head buried in the ground. Its legs slowly moved around in the air. Nearby the beetle were a group of small buildings made of hexagons. And there were lights.

Able sat with Nip on top of the mesa for a long time, marveling at the view. He especially looked to the north where Able could see something he could not even explain. In the direction he looked clouds undulated, but brown, and distinctly separate from the sky.  “I wonder what that is, Nip,” he whispered. He walked in a circle around the top of the mesa and decided to lie down and peer at his own house, hundreds of feet below, but to his horror, the big cart was back. “Oh no! Nip, my father is back.” He reached out to grab Nip by its ring and pulled it close. “Please, Nip, take me back! You have to take me back.”

Nip chirped inquisitively.

“Please, Nip! Down! Back down?”

In a panic, Able grabbed Nip with both hands and started to climb down. Nip shrieked and then opened up panels all over its insides, releasing a flash of light, spinning its halos and straining to slow their fall as they scrabbled to the ground. Able’s heart leapt out of his chest in a way that he had never felt before. He had been afraid of his father many times, but that fear was nauseating and creeping; this fear was sudden and took his breath away. Still, Nip did manage to land them both safely and then ripped himself out of Able’s grasp and flew to Able’s face releasing a stream of clicks, chirps and shrieks as if scolding Able, but Able couldn’t pay any attention.

Running around the side of the cabin, then inside and straight to his room, he found the door open wide and his brother crouched over Ka with a chunk of blackrock in his hand that he was beating Ka with. Ka moaned and had dents and cracks and wasn't to be able to roll away while Able’s brother bashed it again with the stone. Po hid under the bed moaning. “No!” Able roared. Without thinking about anything he grabbed the upraised arm of his brother and threw his entire weight on him, causing the both of them to roll over each other on the floor. 

Kane quickly managed to get Able in a headlock. "What is it, Able? Is it yours?" Able struggled to get free and with ferocity, Nip flew into Kane's face and chirped and squeaked and buzzed. "C'mon, Able, what are these things? Did you use your curse? How do they work?" With Able tucked under one arm, Kane picked up the blackrock and threw it at Ka, laughing.

“No!” Able yelled, having lost all sense of thought, his vision having gone red. "Please! Stop!"

Nip flew to the other side of the room and turning red, flew straight into Kane's head, bashing him hard and causing him to scream and fall, dragging Able on top of himself. "Nip! No!" Able shouted.

Jedidiah came storming into the room on hearing the commotion and saw his one son bleeding and the other waving maniacally at some mystery... thing. He shouted, "The Ungod forsakes us!” He grabbed Able by his neck and hauled him up into the air off his now unconscious brother. “What heresy is this?” he shouted at Able as he pointed to the mistakes. Nip, hovering near Ka, touched its fellow mistake gently and then turned a bright red color and flew in a flash at Jedediah’s face, crackling with bolts of energy. Shocked, Jedediah dropped Able roughly to the ground to swat at Nip who shocked him every time the old man’s stony hands struck him.

Able scrambled to grab his bag and Po and Ka, slipping them both in it and ran for the door past his father still contending with the enraged Nip. As Able ran through the main room to the door, Nip changed from red to orange and slowly hovered away from Jedediah, who stalked the mistake as it floated away, keeping his distance. “This is vile, Able! This is evil! I warned you about your curse and you ignored me!”

Able stood in the main door of the house. From there he could see that his mother had sat up and was staring back and forth from him to Nip to Jedediah. "Mother," was all he could utter as began backing outside and Nip zipped between him and as his father making a cacophony. Jedediah, looming taller than ever and fuming, yelled, “You are a curse on this house! Your mother's heart was too big! You are no son of mine! Get out! Get out of this house, get out of my valley! Never return!”
