# Chapter 1

## In which we meet Able and learn of his simple existence in the Shattered Land.

In a flat stretch between the Delphine Meteor rolling along its canyon, and the Silt Sea shifting in undulations of dust, there was a place called the Desert of Idex Mortez. It was a barren gray vista made up of ancient stone tablets—piled precariously—as high as buildings in places. The piles of tablets lean in all directions as they erode and turn to dust. Upon those millions of stone artifacts were chiseled stories both true and false, philosophies and theories, both true and false, secrets, and myths. They were discarded writings from another age, long forgotten. Even the many languages they were written in are no longer known to anyone.

The piles of ancient texts were interrupted by mesas that lorded over the vast wasteland. There were giant, fossilized trilobites and silt centipedes. Their transparent exoskeletons were draped across the view, many frozen forever in death, in which smaller creatures, like silverfish and scurrying six-legged cybernetic rats, made homes.

A boy named Able lived in the desert of Idex Mortez. At night, while Able poked about the tablets for injured or friendly animals, there were only just a few stars in the night sky and even those had faded to what looked like red smudges. It is black at night in the Desert of Idex Mortez. There is no moon, just a band of faded blue dust stretching across the sky.

The mesas move only at night. Occasionally some errant trader might ride a centipede through the area, looking for schwag or treasure (it is said there are still _books_ in the desert). Those travelers often make the mistake of making camp near a mesa. And when a mesa stands, ripping its long-settled bulk from its crater, stretching out its spindly, crustacean legs, its sudden locution can be heard for miles around like thunder. It is a mystery why the mesas of the Desert of Idex Mortez move at all, but they do, walking for a few hours in the dark of night, lit up by static lightning, only to crash down their entire bulk on a new spot for reasons known only to themselves.

While it is difficult to tell a dead mesa from a living one, it is not impossible. A dead mesa's legs will close up around itself in a tight, spiny fist; like a dried-out spider. Another sign of life is the ultrasonic noise that living mesas put out. You cannot hear it, but you can feel it in the ground. There are other ways, other signs, but the first sign is the best guarantee of some safety.

Nestled beneath one such dead mesa, there is a rusty shack where a man named Jedediah and his family live. He has a wife, Evo and two sons: Able and Kane. Evo is sick and bedridden in the shack, her body covered in rough blankets and surrounded by pumps and machines that are keeping her alive. The older brother is a nasty brute; one who decided to turn his discomfort and pain on others. The youngest son is Able.

Every day, Jedediah and his two sons travel out into the desert where they gather the ancient tablets, stacking them on carts and hauling the refuse back to a clearing between the great dead mesa and their homestead. There, they load the tablets onto a brundlex, which scans the tablets and then pushes them along a conveyor belt where they are crushed. Out of the back of the brundlex comes blackrock—a fuel that can be sold to the trader caravans and others. With the right technology, blackrock can be used to create small amounts of energy, enough to run other brundlexes. The desert rodents, with their built-in brundlexes thrive on blackrock.

A second substance comes from the process. To nearly anyone, it simply looks like dust. But Able can tell the difference between mere dust and electrol. Jedediah keeps the electrol for his younger son Able. The boy has a strange knack for making things with it. It is, without question, a heretical behavior to make the things that Able does. The things... the things-that-move-of-their-own—even the things keeping his wife Evo alive—they are of a spontaneous nature, not of Enubys. One does  make Enubys in the face of Enubys. Movement without soul is to spit in the face of Enubys, but Jedediah is old and tired and loves his wife, so he looks past Able's abilities and strange creations. Still, Jedediah is suspicious of his adopted son and believes him to be cursed.

The desert rodent nearby spews smoke and particles of electrol in an effort to move, but its four back legs are shredded from where a tower of tablets had collapsed on it. It squeaked in panic as Able reached for it. "There, there. You're all right." His words do not calm the creature but it does not defend itself. Able grasps the metallic rat with one hand underneath its first forearms and holds it up in front of his face. Its shining orange eyes beam out and search Able; scan his face. He can see that its light is fading. "You're going to be all right."

The first thing Able does is press his free thumb to the top of the rat's head. The lights in its eyes go out. He laid the rat on its back and removed a bag of electrol from his belt. He poured it liberally on the little creature's back legs and then with a sewing motion, worked the electrol into the legs where it formed new shafts and ligaments. After ten minutes, the rat's four back legs are strong and he once again holds the rat in front of him, presses his thumb to the rat's head, and the lights in its eyes return.

"There. All fixed!"

The rat, detecting its newfound mobility, squirmed in Able's grasp and tried to get free. Able quickly lets it go where it scurried off into a crack between piles of tablets. Able rolls his eyes. "You're welcome."

Evo lay buried among hissing brundlexes that her son Able made for her. She lay in a tattered and gray linen nightgown. In a fever she has pushed all the blankets aside. A mask on her face covered her nose and mouth and only let her breathe with difficulty. Able stood in the doorway, listening to the hum of his machines that are breathing for her. The tall accordion towers surround her and moved asynchronously up and down with tiny huffs and sucking sounds; liquids gush and rush from one tower to another, in to a sphere that spun the liquid and dispensed it again.

Although he brought the machines into existence, he does not know how they function. It is the way of the electrol that he gives his creations a will and a purpose—though he knows the purpose is unnecessary. As bad as he feels for his mother, he feels bad for the machines as well. They will never know more than to do one thing over and over and over.

The small back room where his mother lay is a miniature city skyline, filled with tubes and pipes and dirty glass huddled in around the valley of where her body lay on a small, rotting mattress. A single window, high up on the rickety bedroom wall allows in light, and a tea-colored light pushed through the twin filters of dirt.

Able holds his hands uselessly at his side, then clasps them behind his back. He put them at his side again—watching as the machines make their symphony. The tired light in the room captures and frames a hundred motes of dust, each in a Brownian dance. He closes his eyes and takes a moment to miss her. He travels backwards.

Lost in memories behind closed eyes now, he turns his head up from the floor, playing with bits of rock, to see her looking at him with that familiar and perplexed look on her face, wondering at the measure of oddity in him. He sits and plays with electrol creations that roll about on the floor, aimless but excited. Then, as always she smiles and pats him on the head, the sun behind her silhouette, yellow and streaming. "You are so special Able. You are one of a kind. I love you."

Able opens his eyes to the reality of the room, filled with colors like mold, mildew, rot, and he is not sure why he remembers the sunlight ever being golden. Outside dust devils come to rattle the windows and pay their respects with obsidian-eyed sorrow. East, further off from Jedidiah's little valley, running against the dun-colored sunrises, marred by wavy lines of heat, run the silhouettes of the traders’ centipede caravans; slow, rumbling, and multi-legged.

Able slipped quiet into his room after foraging with his father for the morning. He slid a loop of twine around the door knob and a rusty nail in the wall—a privacy of sorts. Able smiled to himself as he reached underneath his cot for a secret treasure. He smiled because he knows that not all the ideas in the desert are dead, that not all machines have purposes. He has three that he calls his *mistakes*. They are, all three, small orbs of shifting parts and lights. They are more to him than the machines he’s created to assist his mother, at his father’s command. These "mistakes" have no purpose.

When Able has spoken to his Father of machines he has made, his Father’s answer is always the same: “This is a valley of men and women who have been outspoken against the True nature of things; who have thought their words history! They have all been wrong! Their petty and unnatural thoughts have come to rest here because ideas cannot outlast the Ungod of Time. All those outspoken against the True Nature of the universe are dead and wrong. They die with their mistakes. And there is no idea ever conceived that does not rest here; in this desert at the end. Enubys is entropy, boy. Entropy is all.”

Able's mistakes rolled about the floor, lighting up, whirred and blinked as they bumped into the cot and Able and each other. He could hear the sound of his mother’s kind voice, asking him, *What are you dreaming, Able?* Unlike his other creations, these three mistakes were created with no purpose. Instead, when he made them, he tried to imagine what purpose they might want for themselves. 

Po, the littlest of the three wants very little. Able amused himself by walking around the room in a circle and watching as Po followed him everywhere, dodging the other two more rambunctious mistakes, singing a short sweet song of relief when Able sat down and Po could roll up against him and also sit in quiet.

Ka and Nip were much more content to explore the room to its edges, sometimes getting into pushing matches with each other when their paths crossed. In large part they ignored Able and Po except when Able has gathered the electrol to feed them. When Able placed his hand down with a small pile of what he saw as shiny dust, they rolled to him in a hurry and sucked it up with tinks and blips of satisfaction. Able fed Po separately for this reason; the littlest of the three could not compete with its siblings when a feeding happened.

After a feeding, all three of his mistakes would light up much more, burning with orange and violet and green and pink light that seeped out from between their clockworks and panels. Ka would just grow larger, heavier. Nip sometimes would throw out a new appendage of spin around it. Po, though, never changed much, except that his insides, between the cracks in his shell, were more dense than the other two.

Able sat with his arms around his knees, Po by his side, cooing, while Ka and Nip duked it out hyperactively, until the afternoon respite was over. Able’s father will call out from the other room, “Boys!” and Able will herd his mistakes into a small burlap sack where they will fuss at first and then calm down, turn their lights down and “sleep” until later in the day when Able will check on them again.

After today’s feeding Able is delighted and takes in a sharp breath when Nip does something extraordinarily new. After having bumped up against Ka several times, Nip sits still and quivers. Its light fades, and then with a burst of renewed light Nip is surrounded by two halos and lifts itself off the ground! Able’s eyes stretched wide open as Nip hovered over its sibling Ka, circled around it once or twice teasing, and then fluttered back into Able’s hands, as if looking for approval.

Curious, Able held Nip aloft, even though he was not touching it. There was a force field between Able’s hands and Nip’s new rings. The rings around Nip glowed and rotated. Able almost shouted out with glee, before looking around in the quiet. Instead, he held Nip close, a neon green light reflecting on his face, and said, “Nice trick, Nip!”
