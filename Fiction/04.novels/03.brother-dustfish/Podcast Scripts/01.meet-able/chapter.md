You are listening to “The Arrival of Brother Dustfish” Episode #1 in a 25 episode limited series podcast.

# Introduction

In a shattered land, an unusually talented, exiled boy will seek out the Ultracircus. His search, and arrival at that place, will create the legend of Brother Dustfish. It is a legend, believed by few. It is part of a larger older legend, that there is one who will stop The Shattered Land from finally falling apart. The measure of destruction of the loss of time or logic in this particular place has been well realized. But no answer has risen or revealed itself.

To quote the Master of Mistakes:
> “Our astrologers have written it: the moon has fallen. And, this event is a sign of the end of times. The moon has fallen and who among us can lift it back to its home?

# Episode 1, Part 1

## In which we meet Able and learn of his simple _existence_ in the Shattered Land.

In the far reaches of the Shattered Land, /between/ where the Moon rolls along its canyon and the Silt Sea shifts in undulations of dust, there is a place called the Desert of Dead Ideas. It's a barren gray landscape made up of piles of ancient stone tablets; piled as high as buildings in some places; piled precariously, leaning in the wind. Upon those millions of stone  artifacts are chiseled stories true and false, philosophies and theories, secrets and myths. They are all discarded, they are all very long forgotten. It is the Desert of Dead Ideas after all.

Very little lives in that desert. Those miles of piles of ancient texts are dotted only by Mesas that \lord\ over the vast wasteland, \and defiantly so\. Those few creatures — fossilized, giant stone crabs and silt centipedes — who choose to venture too far into the desert from the Silt Sea — well, their husk/s/ are draped across the stone tablets and now their bodies only make homes for smaller things like silverfish and scurrying six-legged cybernetic rodents.

Why so much knowledge and history and law and philosophy had ever been \discarded\ in the middle of a desert is unknown to any in the Shattered Land. Very few of the tablets, and very little of the writing can be read by anyone anymore. The language is lost. The tablets are a mix of languages and symbols, many from societies that no longer exist on the planet; their scribblings are just now representations of death. There is so much dust — and the winds of heat carry the well-kept knowledge further away into the distance and erode it to nothing.

The Mesas move only at night. Occasionally some errant trader might ride a silt centipede through the area, looking for some schwag or treasure (it is said there are still _books_ in the desert). Those travelers often make the mistake of making camp near a mesa. And when a mesa stands, ripping its long-settled bulk from its crater, stretching out its spindly legs, it’s sudden locution can be heard for miles around, like an explosion. It is a mystery why the Mesas of the Desert of Dead Ideas move at all, but they do, walking for a few hours in the dark of night, often lit up by static lightning, only to crash down their entire bulk on some new spot for reasons known only to themselves.

It is difficult to tell a dead Mesa from a living one, but not impossible. To begin with, if a Mesa’s legs are outstretched, it is very likely dead. There are other ways, other signs, but this first sign is the best guarantee. And so, nestled beneath one such dead mesa, there is a rusty shack where a man named Jedediah and his family live. The mother is sick and lying in a bed in the shack surrounded by pumps and machinations that are keeping her alive. The older brother is a nasty brute; one who decided to turn his discomfort and pain on others. The youngest son is Able.

Every day, Jedediah and his two sons travel out into the desert where they gather the ancient tablets, stacking them on carts and hauling the refuse back to a clearing between the great dead mesa and their homestead. There, they load the tablets onto the grundle, which scans the tablets and then pushes them along a conveyor belt where the tablets of philosophies are crushed. Out of the back of the grundle comes *blackrock* — a mild fuel that can be sold to the trader caravans and others. With the right technology, blackrock can be used to create some light and small amounts of energy. The desert rodents, with their built-in grundles thrive on the stuff. Well, they animate.  A second substance comes from the process as well; considered to be waste. It is a silver dust known (not by the locals) as electrum; it is exhaust from the grundle, exhaust from the wildlife. Jedediah cares nothing for the electrum, but he allows Able to have it because the boy has a strange knack for making things with it. It is, without question, a heretical behavior to make the things that Able does… One does does make J'onn in the face of J'onn nor movement in the face of J'onn but Jedediah looks past it. The things… the things-that-move-of-their-own… that is what is keeping Mother alive. And Jedediah is suspicious of his youngest son.

## And now, an intermission…

# Episode 1, Part 2

## In which we learn that Able can keep his mother alive with willed machines.

She lay buried among the hissing bio-grundles, in a tattered and gray linen nightgown. Able is not entirely sure she is even there since he can barely see her from where he stands in the doorway, but he can hear the grundles breathing for her. The little accordion towers surround her and move asynchronously up and down with tiny huffs and sucking sounds; liquids gush and rush from one tower to another, to some sphere that spins the liquid and dispenses it again. Though he brought them into existence, he does not know how they function. It is the way of the electrum that he gives it freedom, will and a goal.

The small back room is a miniature city skyline, almost entirely filled with tubes and pipes and dirty glass huddled in around the valley of instruments where her body lay on the small, rotting mattress. Only a single window, high up on the rickety bedroom wall allows in any light, and only a tea-colored light pushes through the twin filters of dirt and fingerprints on the inside and gray restless dust outside.

Able shifts his weight in the doorway and hears the tired floorboards beneath him creak, like a mourning that is disturbingly louder than his own. His is lost in confusion. He holds his hands uselessly at his side. Then clasps them behind his back. Then, he puts them at his side again — watching as the grundles rise and fall, his eyes moving from cylinder to cylinder as each one reaches a peak, seems to hold a breath, puffs and whooshes down again. The room is small chamber orchestra of gushing flushes, heaving movement, clicks and sighs.

Falling in a staccato shuddering, the paper lungs huff dust off into the air in snowy spirals where the tired light captures and frames each particle’s Brownian dance, the bludgeoning of a thousand tiny, invisible fists. Able feels each molecule of pollutant travel up his nose and down his dry throat into his crusted lungs. He closes his eyes and takes a moment to miss her. He travels backwards.

Lost in memories behind closed eyes now, he turns his head up from the floor, playing with bits of rock, to see her looking at him with that familiar and perplexed look on her face, wondering at the measure of her own oddity in him. He sits and plays with electrum creations that roll about on the floor, aimless but somehow excited. Then, as always she smiles and pats him on the head, the sun behind her silhouette, yellow and streaming.

Able opens his eyes to the reality of the room, filled with colors like mold, mildew, rot, and he is not sure why he remembers the sunlight ever being yellow.

Outside dust devils come to rattle the window and pay their respects with obsidian-eyed sorrow. The land is gray and covered with discarded speeches and arguments, stone artifacts chiseled with letters, the broken tablets of theorems and laws and philosophies, all overshadowed by a mesa, at the base of which sits Able’s father’s disheveled house. A few hundred yards away from their pathetic shack is a shallow grave that Able’s brother has dug. There, two rotted pieces of lumber, tied together with twine, lean miserably in amongst the detritus of long-forgotten ideas.

The mesa is singular. It dominates the landscape like a termite mound with giant three foot outstretched termite legs. For miles around it is the only structure aside from a decrepit and bony hand of a tree reaching up thirty-five feet from the ground to the north. East, further off from the tree, sometimes running against the dun-colored sunrises, marred by wavy lines of heat, run the silhouettes of the skin traders’ centipede caravans; slow, rumbling, and multi-legged.
