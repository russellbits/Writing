# Ideas

+ Wacamolo tells a story about bees and one bee who thought he had free will.

+ The signal from the Texo Compass is intercepted and pulls the crew to Sulcata Nur Waya. The city has been overtaken by Tet, Gef's "brother" a synthezoid who worked for Enki and is attempted to build an escape from the world and the Shattering. He thinks Enki was right that eternal growth over sustainability is paramount. He also believe that Enki didn't go far enough. He plans to completely destroy the Obtala and use the Ultracircus as a raft to get to the next realm. He's not evil, but like Thanos, his plan is misguided. He has Horr'off locked up.

+ What is Gef's story? Who was Gef working for? Is Wacamolo more than he lets onâ€”like Fizban?

+ The villain of this story did what he did out of love; he didn't mean for the destruction to happen. But so long as its happened, he sees it as progress. We now know that he did it to find some infinite energy source.

+ ~~Po eats the Texo Compass~~

+ Evo was a member of the council. She alone among scientists of the council re-discovered the ability to create synthezoids. She created a child synthezoid in the hopes of creating a true form of optimism and balance and sustainability in opposition to Gabriel's ideas of constant growth.

+ Ghendra was Evo's student.

+ ~~The crew meets a thing like Nip but massive and dangerous.~~ The crew meets something like the mistakes in the Automatic Jungle.

+ ~~The crew has to make their way through a jungle of nanotechnology that tries to transform them.~~

+ ~~Rilla and Wacamolo show up with Arthra and stuff at the entrance to the city of Horn.~~

+ Nip becomes a swarm. Arthra learns to fly (by walking on copies of Nip).

+ Baron Leocadia sends bounty hunters after the crew.

+ The crew acquires a fighter of some kind. Do they free a mechanoman?
