R. E. Warner is a brain in a jar. We keep him in our book warehouse where he is allowed to read at his leisure and freely dictate, via computer, stories that are for all practical purposes rip-offs of a lot of other stories and movies (he can access screenplays, too). As a brain in a jar, he complains A LOT about not being able to eat pizza.
