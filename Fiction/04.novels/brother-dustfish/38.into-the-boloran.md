# Chapter 38

## Into the Boloran

The crew steered up the waterway leading to the Sund fjord with Arthra, along with two new mounts, mechadons, on one of which rode Tet and the other Nicolle. They had made their way out of Sund and the ruins of Sund Lei to the rocky origins of the fjord. Beyond the fjord stood the massive Boloran mountain range. The gray, sometime blue, mountains reached skyward and hid their heads in the clouds. Several of the crew had never seen clouds—these hazy or fluffy things that looked  like smoke but were still and white.

Having sworn Able to secrecy about the Vault and Grokkon, Nicolle and Xistra had alas elected not to tell anyone else about what happened. From Grokkon’s reaction regarding Tet, they knew not to tell him, but Xistra had particularly suspected that Tet had ways of spying on them that they were not aware of as of yet. Xistra even went so far as to suggest that perhaps it was Tet who destroyed the vault, although Nicolle pointed out that Tet had been with Gef all day securing the new mounts and Arthra. Xistra argued, “We’ve seen him build new synthezoid bodies and a marcobot take on superpositions recently. We just don’t know what kind of science he could be using against us.” Nicolle didn’t relent, but did set the argument aside with the agreement that they would be very careful. With the new information the three had acquired, the mission hadn’t changed. They would need to reach Uchava for some means of flight to search for the Ultracircus.

Sitting in one of Arthra’s pods’ litters—another nice addition acquired in Sund—Able told Wacamolo about the tiles around the vault. Rilla lay next to him sleeping under a very soft, new blanket. Of course, to Able’s mind he had to keep the secret of what was *in* the vault but not that they had found it or how.

Wacamolo stroked his bushy beard. “And with that information you were able to open the vault?”

“We needed Nicolle’s ring, too. But I swore to Nicolle and Xistra to keep secret what we found inside.”

“Ah. A secret,” said Wacamolo.

“Nicolle and Xistra thought that maybe we couldn’t trust someone.” Able cocked his head to one side toward Tet on his mechadon.

“I see,” said Wacamolo.

Able looked down. “Sorry.”

“That’s all right, Able.” Wacamolo pat his hand. “Sometimes we must keep secrets to be safe, especially in times when danger is about.” Wacamolo paused to stare out the litter window at Tet. He turned his attention back to Able. “But I assume you spoke with Grokkon?”

Able looked perplexed, then upset and he whispered, “But I didn’t say anything!”

“No, Able. No, you didn’t.”

It just kept getting colder. Able didn’t care, his fusion heart kept his temperature perfectly regulated. In this particular instance though, seeing Wacamolo and Rilla shivering even when covered in blankets, Able concentrated and turned his temperature up until the litter was more comfortable.

“Able, since we are discussing Tet, what do you know about synthezoids?”

“Only what Gef has told me, really.”

“And Tet?”

“He hasn’t told me much of anything.”

Rilla jumped in, “I can tell you all about synthezoids. They’re not made of skin and squishy stuff. They can see and hear and smell more than we can. They can’t drown. They’re tough but smart—“

“Thank you, Rilla. I appreciate your enthusiasm as always, but I was more driving at history. What does Able know about his people.”

Able shrugged. “Until I met Gef, I didn’t think I had a people. I thought I was alone.” 

Rilla reached up and put her hand on Able’s shoulder to comfort him. She knew about loneliness.

“Evo never discussed it with you?”

“No.”

Wacamolo sighed. “Perhaps she meant to, I think. I think she was raising you a certain way. You see, Able, your people are not born the same way we organics are—one from another. Your people are born from a vast machine called the orchard. Generally speaking, synthezoids are born fully grown the way they are and they are born knowing everything they will ever need to know.”

Abe laughed, “I wish I knew everything.”

Wacamolo scratched his beard, “Well, it’s not that they know everything. They are born knowing what they need to know to fulfill their quest. Every synthezoid is... was... born with a very distinct purpose. Generally, the ancient council of scientists ruled that once a synthezoids purpose was complete, they were free to invent their own. Before the Shattering, most synthezoids left the planet to go form their own society on the moon, Zendo.
