# Chapter 3

## In which Able wanders the Desert of Idex Mortez with Po, Ka and Nip

With no direction to follow other than his father’s bony index finger jabbing like a dagger away, Able trudged toward the upside-down beetle. He didn’t know why he was heading there, other than the faint idea that it was better than staying. With its mysterious half-buried hives, there might be something for him to—he didn't know what. Suddenly, as he had granted his mistakes, he also had no purpose. At the bottom of the hill between his Father's cabin and the brummagem breaking brundlex, he quickly swept up as much electrol as he could find. When the bag felt heavy enough, he hoisted it over his shoulder and started moving again.

Scrambling over a path that wound through the graveyard of thought and invention; piles of cartridges, motherboards, antenna, discs, with a sack of electrol, Able with Po and Ka stowed in a bag, with Nip flitting about his head,  inched his way through small paths that had been carved out over many years by his family and others who mined the scrap. Hours passed like this, and by the time he stumbled into a crater—an immense hollow where a mesa had once rested—the sky had deepened to a bruised purple.

The crater stretched wide and jagged, its edges like the tissue of an ancient wound. Able slid down its slope, loose shards of metal clattering beneath his boots. At the bottom, he stopped, finally letting the weight of the day press down on him. He dropped his bags and sat with his back against the crater wall. Nip hovered high above, its green-yellow light beaming like a satellite.

It was then that Able realized the full scope of his dilemma. He was alone, at night, when the mesas traveled (crushing everything underfoot). He did not know where he was going. He had no reason to go anywhere. He turned to the only thing he had: the sack of electrol. He might as well feed his mistakes. As he sat and fed Po, Ka and Nip, more problems surfaced. And of all of them, the worst was that he was not sure if he would ever see his mother again.

As usual, Po quickly re-electroled and rolled to Able's backside to hide behind him. Poor Ka, though, was in bad shape. It had gashes in its side that were leaking a vermillion dust. Nip was high above the crater, about in its center, hovering. When Able looked up, Nip was the brightest thing in the night sky. There were few stars to be seen, not that Able knew what stars were. He thought, *maybe they’re siblings of Nip*?

He attended to Ka, taking a handful of electrol from his sack and pouring it on and around Ka, who seemed to swell up a tad and then sigh, and then shudder. As it did so, Ka retracted in size a smidge and then the gashes disappeared from its surface. Ka brightened in color.

"Feeling better, then?" Able asked, and Ka spun in a circle and chirped.

"At least one of us is doing all right." He reached out and pet Ka, who reacted in no particular way, just rolling in angled circles, appearing to enjoy his renewed smooth surface.

Able peered under his arm at Po. Po never grew in size or transformed like Nip. "My father said I was a runt. Are you a runt?"

Po growled.

Finally Able turned a handful of electrol up to the sky, looking up at Nip. Nip made no noise, did not move closer. Ka was bright enough that it never really got dark at the bottom of the crater, and Able curled up at the bottom of the ridge and slept, hoping that mesas did not come to rest at the same place twice.

The next morning, Able found himself standing at the edge of the crater, watching the upside-down beetle loom ever closer, its spindly legs frozen mid-scramble, jutting skyward like the dead remains of a colossal, alien arachnid. The wind tore at him as he moved, carrying with it the endless whispers of the valley, secrets murmured through the currents of dust and grit. The world had never seemed so vast, and for the first time, Able felt like something small and strange within it. He pressed on, though his curiosity outpaced his stride.

Also that morning Able awoke with Po and Ka close by his side, but Nip, back down from his vigil, was scrounging around in the sack of electrol. Able tried to drag him out of the bag to make sure that he would not eat all of it, but Nip was too heavy. Instead, Able had to pull the bag off Nip, revealing a very swollen machine, faceted like a jewel, angles rising and falling in mesmerizing patterns.

Able shooed Po and Ka (who were rolling in a perimeter around Nip) back into their bag. He picked up what was left of the electrol, and then began to make his way to the opposite side of the crater. But when it became obvious that Nip was not following, Able turned and walked back to him. "Are you sick? Did you eat too much?"

Nip hummed faintly like a restaurant patron on their fourteenth waffle.

"I'm not leaving without you. You need to come along." Able tried to push Nip with his shoe, but the mistake wouldn't move. Able squatted down to Nip's level. "You don't *look* sick." He reached out to grab Nip's outer ring, hoping to be able to drag the little machine, but much to his surprise, the ring was warm and removable. Able lifted the outer ring up and with a loud *brrraaaat* Nip's center ring and then the core of the mistake rose up from the ground as if pulled by puppet strings. All of Nip's parts were in line with the outer ring raised over Able's head. Nip's core spun wildly in midair, vacillating from a smooth sphere to a pointed dodecahedron while the spinning center ring made a whumping sound. Nip's center shimmered like a rainbow, one color chasing another all across its core. The ring begin to pull up on Able's hand and lifted his arm up over his shoulder. Able hung on, but wasn't sure he should. "We tried this before, Nip! I don't think it's a good idea!”

The core spun until it was bright white, the humming turning into a melodic chord, then a flash, then two metallic ribbons burst out from the core and dropped down to wrap around Able's waist and behind his legs. The tones that Nip was emitting grew louder and higher, as Nip began to lift Able off the ground. As Nip beamed and sounded out, Able found himself sitting comfortably in a swing seat made of the metallic ribbons. Then, Nip's music ceased, and light burst out of it, returning it to a bright green shimmering. Its core took the form of a flattened dodecahedron, cool and luminous, and the sound returned to a low hum. Before Able knew it, they were above the crater and racing off in the air toward the upside-down beetle.

* * *

The descent was nothing like the chaotic tumble from the dead mesa nights ago. This landing had grace to it. Nip brought Able to the ground with care about ten feet away from the beetle. Only now, it didn't look so much like a beetle. Up close, it revealed itself to be something else entirely. Its legs were long and strangely smooth, less like insect limbs and more like enormous thumbs. They didn't thrash in desperation as he had expected but swung gently, pendulous and deliberate. Each leg ended in a lazy turning fan, as if the thing were idling. Nip retracted its ribbons and hovered in place. Able reached up and patted him, "Thanks, Nip. That might've taken us days to walk."

They had landed on top of a hill, and from where they were, Able could see new things. For one, he could see the top of the dead mesa near his father's house, smaller now than he had ever seen it. Knowing he could travel faster with the help of Nip, he felt less upset about being away from home and his mother. Maybe his father would calm down. He could go back later.

Looking down the hill, away from his home, he saw the structures that looked like hives. They were covered in hexagonal windows, almost the whole of them being dark glass, their purpose inscrutable. Not too far from those structures, he could see a figure digging in the ground with methodical determination. *Well*, Able thought, *I guess I could ask where I am*.
