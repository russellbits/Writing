# Chapter 2

## In which Able

Able dumped an armload of clanking mass of refuse onto the conveyor belt. He watched as the relics rumbled down to the brundlex that crushed and fired it into powders, saddened by the sense that these scraps once carried a purpose he would never now know. Suddenly, painfully, he was awakened from his brief reverie by his brother slamming a cart into his back. Able staggered forward, turning to see his brother’s smug grin.

“Get moving, clockworks.” The words were a familiar barb, spoken with disdain. Kane hated his little synthetic brother. 

Able stepped aside to let his big brother lift the cart’s contents on to the conveyor belt. He bent down and rubbed the backs of his ankles. His father approached with another cart, shouted out to Able, “If you don’t keep moving in this world, son, it will cause you nothing but pain.”

Able didn’t reply, instead wandering away from his father and brother off toward one of the mesa’s legs. He climbed a high pile of jetsam to the top and scanned southern horizon for any of the dust clouds kicked up by the traders and their centipedes. This day he saw nothing, just an expanse, broken and empty. Later, after many more armfuls of dross had been crushed and churned and broken, Able and his brother and father loaded a large cart with the blackrock. The cart was as tall as Jedediah, groaning under its weight, and required both Able’s brother and his father to pull it down the long, uneven trail to a small station where they pile the blackrock in the hopes that traders would come and leave grain or jerky or cloth or wood in trade. This journey would take several hours, and to Able, their absence was a rare reprieve and the best part of his day.

As Jedediah and Able’s brother were preparing to leave, Able—almost without thinking—said, “Father, I think I could make a machine that would pull the cart for you, if you like.”

Jedediah turned to Able, a lean silhouette against the low gray sky. He removed his large-brimmed black hat and wiped his brow. “No.” Able was not sure what to make of the response. He stood dutifully waiting to be dismissed, looking up at his father, whose eyes were so wrinkled and frowning that Able could barely see his pupils. “We do that for your mother because she is *ill*. We men, and you, have our health and it is ungodly to use your—“ Able’s father searched the sky for the word, “—your curse.” The word landed with a weight that made Able flinch. “We have our health and should do this work ourselves.”

After a moment, Able’s father squatted down to Able's level and said, with more patience, “The Ungod forsook this world because men were lazy. Whatever your creations are, Able, you must not use them idly. You should not use them at all... unless you must.” Able’s father put his heavy, almost stony hand on Able’s shoulder. “You can still be an ungodly man, my son, but to do so you must be humble about what you make.” Able looked to the ground and thought about the mistakes in his room, hidden beneath his cot. Jedediah’s grip tightened slightly. “Humble yourself before what you’ve been given, or it’ll own you.”

After his father and brother had left, leaving the air heavy with the silence of the brundlex, and after he had checked on his mother, Able sat on the floor of his room among his mistakes. For weeks now, after a feeding, Nip, the most curious of his creations now, fluttered about in the dim light. And now, for the last few days, Nip had taken to flying up next to a small window, high in the room. Nip would sit at the window, bumping against the glass with a faint, rhythmic insistence. Able, stared up at Nip said, “There’s nowhere to go, Nip.”

Nip flitted several times from the window to Able, but when Able tried to hold the flying mistake, the little machine whisked off back to the glass. After a while, Nip did what it did that first time it transformed, hovering in place and quivering, its glow intensifying, pulsing with a sharp, frantic rhythm, growing brighter and brighter. The light became so bright that even little Po came out from behind Able to look. Able sat up, alarmed. (Ka was paying no attention whatsoever to his sibling’s seeming tantrum.) The light grew searing, casting vivid green shadows across the walls. Then, with a flash, Nip had sparked a third, new halo, and in a fury, Nip’s glow surged bright green and in a flash Nip shot through the window, shattering the glass in a burst of sound and fragments.

Able’s eyes grew wide in horror. “No, no, no, Nip! Nip!” He scrambled up and ran to the wall. The window was too high for him to reach. He strained to see if he could make out the mistake anywhere in the sky. It was bad enough if his father saw the broken window, but that was not what made Able’s chest ache. His mistake had left him and in a strange way it felt like a piece of himself had left, lost to the vast, uncaring world beyond.

* * *

The broken window, much to Able’s relief, was blamed on an errant rock shaken loose from the mesa. Able escaped punishment, which usually consisted of Jedidiah having him break something he loved—it hardly mattered what. It was a grim ritual that Jedediah justified as "teaching humility." 

Able scoured the towers of junk for days searching for Nip but seeing no signs anywhere. Each morning, as he trudged around the mesa collecting refuse for the brundlex, he kept his eyes sharp for the faintest glimmer of green. Every night, when the sun set, despite the danger, he snuck outside hoping that the dim, blue, light of the Skybow would be enough to let him see the outline of the compact, ringed machine. Or that in this world of shifting shadows and whispers, Nip’s light might pierce the darkness. Unlike his family, he didn’t require sleep. He would stay out late. Still, the desert was vast and his efforts felt futile.

One day, after his father and brother had hauled the big cart away, he open the simmering brundlex to collect its cache of electrol to feed Po and Ka. Without Nip, the two remaining mistakes had thrived on the surplus. Po, still small, had grown sturdier, while Ka—always the glutton—was now the size of Able’s head, its mechanisms clicking and whirring with disconcerting vigor.

When Able went to feed them, he was ecstatic to open his sack and see that there were once again three mistakes. *Three*. Po, Ka and...

“Nip!” Able whispered, pulling the third creation into the light. It wasn’t quite the Nip he remembered. This Nip was altered—half the size of Ka now, no longer a smooth sphere but encircled by a gleaming ring of polished metal, its surface bristling with spires that glinted in the dim sunlight coming through the high, still unrepaired window. 

He had no doubt it was Nip. No sooner than all the three mistakes emerged, Nip and Ka resumed their rivalry, colliding with one another in a mechanical dance of clicks and whirs. Nip hovered inside its new ring but it wasn’t long at all before its three halos appeared and it was off the ground again. Nip rushed by Able’s face a few times, even faster than it had been when it had left before. It hovered in front of Able and Able gently put out his hands to hold it. When he cupped it gently, Nip seemed to hum with satisfaction, glowing faintly under his touch. But it wasn’t content to rest for long. It tugged at him insistently, pulling him toward the wall with the broken window.

“What is it, Nip?” Able asked, already following.

When he grasped the vertical ring around Nip, its purpose became startlingly clear. The mistake lifted him clean off the ground, its augmented strength carrying him upward with surprising grace. Able scrambled onto the window ledge, his heart pounding in exhilaration. Nip made the strangest cheering tweet. “Wow, Nip. Neat!” laughing as the mistake chirped in triumph.

Nip wasn’t finished. Able tightened his grip as Nip hauled him out the of window. Po and Ka watched and made songs of ah, like watching fireworks. Nip whisked Able far above the cabin, around and above the great spiny legs of the dead mesa and with a loud triumphant sequence of chirps, pulling Able into the open sky. Able gasped as the ground fell away, the world transforming beneath him into a sprawling tableau of peaks, valleys, and winding paths carved into the desert. Nip carried him in a wide arc, soaring up the side of the mesa until it gently landed him at the top.

Able was ecstatic now, containing himself only just, as he stood on top of the mesa and looked all around at the yellow afternoon sky, the Skybow of the Goliaths shimmering faintly gray in the tea-stained sunlight. He could see so far he didn’t even know what he was looking at. Far below, the junk fields spread like a patchwork quilt, each pile and path blending into a strange, almost beautiful landscape, like a circuit board unto itself. To the east, a peculiar shape caught his eye—a colossal horn of sorts, its surface sprouting smaller, spiraling horns. It shimmered faintly in the distance, hazy on the horizon like a mirage.

Closer, something stranger: a beetle the size of a house, its head buried deep in the ground, its legs moving aimlessly in the air. Smoke curled lazily from its carapace, and surrounding it were a cluster of hexagonal domes, their metallic surfaces gleaming. Lights blinked and flickered among them, casting tiny beacons of intrigue into the vast, empty desert.

Able’s heart raced as he took it all in. The mesa, the junk, the desert—all of it felt suddenly small compared to what might lie beyond. Nip buzzed at his side, a soft, eager hum, as if to say, *This is just the beginning*.

* * *

Able sat with Nip on top of the mesa for a long time, marveling at the view, Nip an oscillation of halos casting ripples of light across the dust-scoured plateau. The world stretched vast and unknowable in every direction, a patchwork of metallic mounds and jagged canyons. Northward, the horizon buckled under a shifting tide of brown clouds, billowing with a strange, rhythmic pulse like breath. Able squinted at it, unsettled. "What do you suppose that is, Nip?" he murmured, the words slipping into the wind like stray thoughts. Nip chirped softly, its response more question than answer. 

He walked in a circle around the top of the mesa and decided to lie down on his belly and peer over the edge at his own house, hundreds of feet below. The shanty cabin looked like a toy, crooked against the waste. But then his stomach flipped when to his horror, he saw that the big cart was back. “Oh no, Nip! My father is back!” He reached out to grab Nip by its ring and pulled it close. “Please, Nip, take me back! You have to take me back!”

The little construct gave an uncertain trill.

“Please, Nip! Down! Back down?”

In a panic, Able grabbed Nip with both hands and started to climb down. Nip shrieked and its panels all flared open all over its sides, releasing a flash of light, spinning its halos and straining to slow their fall as they scrabble-jumped to the ground. The landing was hard but safe. Able’s heart leapt out of his chest in a way that he had never felt before. He had been afraid of his father many times, but that fear was nauseating and creeping; this fear was sudden. Nip ripped itself out of Able’s grasp and flew to his face spinning and chirping in agitated bursts, scolding him with mechanical vigor, but Able could pay no attention.

Running around the side of the cabin, then inside, the smell of sweat and hot metal greeted him. A sharp, rhythmic clanging was coming from his room. There he found the door open wide and his brother crouched over Ka with a chunk of blackrock in his hand. Kane was beating Ka with it. Ka moaned. The mistake was battered, its once-smooth surface dented and cracked, wobbling weakly as Kane raised the rock for another strike. Po hid under the bed crying.

“No!” Able roared, throwing himself forward. His hands closed around Kane’s arm, his synthetic strength overwhelming the older boy's muscles. They crashed to the floor in a tangle of limbs, Kane snarling, "What’s wrong with you, Able? Are these things yours? Did you use your *curse*?” Kane wriggled free long enough to snatch the blackrock again and fling it at Ka. Able screamed, his voice ragged, “Stop it! Please!”

Nip blazed red and darted at Kane, slamming into his face with a crackling burst of energy. Kane cried out, swatting at the construct as it zipped back for another strike. "C'mon, Able, what are these things? How do they work?” He reached for Ka, but Able struck him with a fist and knocked him to the floor.

“No!” Able yelled, having lost all sense of thought, his vision having gone red. "Please! Stop!"

Jedidiah stormed into the room on hearing the commotion and saw his one son bleeding and the other waving maniacally at a heresy—Jedidiah knew what it was the moment he saw it. He shouted, "The Ungod forsakes us!” With one hand, he grabbed Able by the neck and hoisted him clear off the floor away from his now unconscious brother. Able’s legs kicked uselessly as Jedediah shouted like a thunderclap, “What heresy is this?” 

Nip, hovering near Ka, touched its fellow mistake gently and then turned back to a bright red color and flew in a flash at Jedediah’s face, crackling with bolts of energy, its halos shimmering with sparks. Shocked, Jedediah dropped Able to the ground to swat at Nip who electrocuted Jedediah every time the old man’s stony hands struck it.

Able hit the floor, coughing, but wasted no time. He snatched up Ka and Po, slipping both into his bag as Jedidiah bellowed curses. As Able ran through the main room to the door, Nip changed from red to orange and slowly hovered away from Jedediah, who stalked the mistake as it floated away, keeping his distance. “This is vile, Able! This is evil! I warned you about your curse and you ignored me, you ungrateful wretched invention!”

As Able reached the threshold, he froze. From there he could see that his mother had sat up and was staring back and forth from him to Nip to Jedediah. “Mother,” he choked, the word catching in his throat. For a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath. He backed outside and Nip zipped between him and as his father, a cloud of cacophony. Jedediah, looming taller than ever, his fury filling the silence. “You are a curse on this house! Your mother's heart was too big! You are no son of mine! Get out! Get out of this house! Get out of my valley! Never return!”

Able stumbled out the door, the weight of Po and Ka pulling on his shoulders, Nip buzzing at his side like a tiny, furious guardian. He looked back once, at his mother’s haunted face and his father’s towering rage, then turned toward the vast emptiness beyond what was once his home. His legs carried him forward, toward a horizon of dust and shadows. The sky, smeared with the browns and reds of an impending storm swallowed him whole.
