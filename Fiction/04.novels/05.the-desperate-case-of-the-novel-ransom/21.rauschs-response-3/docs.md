`Allen, we've played this game to a stalemate.`[^31]

`Congratulations, also, on finding Paul. Also, our condolences. It was very unexpected that you would find him. How fascinating that footsteps from your memory and your writing took you to him. Would Reza call this a coincidence, we wonder? What would Reza tell us about this? Surely, he would say that there was no coincidence in it. It was surely the guiding hand of the upper dimensions; some secrets from the tendril, whispered to your dreams. We do look forward to an answer about that.` [^32]

`In many ways, this has been a Baptism by fire, and the Baptism, we feel, is over. Now is is time to begin the Communion. Obey us and by late in the day, you will be re-united with your wife and daughter. We will still require much of you, and we will have your cooperation, but you will be comforted in the knowledge that your loves will be close and safe.`

`We don't want your wife. We don't want your daughter. They are, as Reza dictates, trifling to the consequence of the play of the Universe. They only stand in the way of the watched clock. We want Reza Bahadir. You will give us Reza Bahadir or we will destroy everything you have. And how appropriate, because as Reza says: "Without witness, there is nothing," We are many; the children of Reza. We like to add that with nothing comes no witness.`

`When we have Reza, the hands will be aligned and our dreams will grant us the portal we seek—the portal to the city of Hormirzad.`[^33]

`Tomorrow, you will dress as Paul did. You will be the courier now; the courier *and* the package. We have made arrangements with your detectives to be sure that you will have your phone with you when we come to accept the writings you must deliver. Bring only these things: the writings, the phone, the clothes of the courier. You have our permission to leave even yourself behind.`

[^31]: It's 'we' now? What does that even mean?

[^32]: What *would* Reza say about this?

[^33]: This is crucial. Hormirzad comes up in an old story by Reza. During his time living near the Persian Gulf, near the Strait of Hormuz, he lived in a town that he referred to in one journal as Hormirzad; only that is not the modern name of the place. The city is currently known as Bandar Abbas. Even though Reza wrote in the early twentieth century, he tended to refer to Bandar Abbas as Hormirzad as he felt that was the original and ancient name of the city, dating back to the first century. Many of his stories originated from that city, for instance the story of Nader Aga takes place in the city of Hormirzad. I wonder about this because now that I see it mentioned in Rausch's email, I think I may have gotten the dates concerning Nader Aga wrong—that it was a much older story than I originally suspected. Still, this mention of Hormirzad means that I should concern myself with that and other Reza Bahadir stories that took place during this time. This group must be placing some sort of meaning on it, so I need to be sure to bring two things with me to the drop off tomorrow.
