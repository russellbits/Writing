title: An Interlude
---

Reader, if you exist, if you are out there, I want to take a moment to speak to you.

I've talked a lot about authors who make up authors and talk about their stories. 

I've talked a lot about legends and myths.

I've talked a lot about found journals and found stories and translating old texts.

I am the author, speaking to you now. Please listen carefully.

You know how I left the last chapter in a cliffhanger? That's because it's me at the school, that's because it's me that went through that. It's ten o'clock at night and right now it's just you and me and me telling you what happened earlier today. And before I continue, I need to show you something.

It occurs to me that Rausch doesn't need this novel completed. He doesn't need me. His game is truly, truly mad—so much more so than I thought in the beginning. He's already extracted an incredible amount from me, and should he like, he can just put the unfinished business up on the Internet or whatever is the equivalent in the future just like a hunter might mount a head on a wall. Look at what I've done to this beast! Maybe he'll print it and just distribute it as a pamphlet. Maybe he is as mad as the psychopaths that hold newspapers for ransom. Do any of us know what they're thinking? Do any of us really understand their manifestos, so completely outside the norm of *our* lives.

Should he do that, I want this section included. Like I said, there's just no guarantee of this, except that I think Rausch wants the whole story, and, Rausch, I am typing this right now. RIGHT NOW. You can't take that from me, no matter what sort of mad man you are. You can't define what you *think* a novel is no matter how hard you try to force it, and if I want the following words in this book, then it is still a novel and damn it, I want this.

Whatever happens going forward, there is something that I wrote that I want—demand—included here. It is a poem. It is my favorite poem. I have written hundreds. They are worthless. I don't care about them. This one, this poem captured a moment so true to me, the poem is the only way I can explain it. Please, Rausch, please make sure that if this horrible screed ever sees the light of day, you will include this. It is a poem called "Architect of Accident." It is a day that I will remember always and it was a day that happened before you or my family existed, and I want it here.

Architect of Accident  

Three quarter clouded moon  
over ocean’s persistent crystal light  
dances a path to walk  
alone in a night-time myopia  

silence stills the heady  
dialogue of bright day  
and moon’s wide and fuzzy halo  
is a quiet amphitheater  

for the performance of ocean waves  
their dark body, bright foam, an inverted tide  
come to take all  
your should’ves away.  
and lap
deep thunderous.

At the First far falling star  
overhead, you sit in awe alone  
wide-eyes peeled to bay of light  
Her communique  
She to you alone, who walks this late  

who came to worship at the temple of  
the architect of accident  
when all the voices insisted  
hitch-hiked on you to this quiet place  
they all  
fall silent one by one  
until left are none  

and the second falling star  
is a real thing.  

And the ocean, not something to fathom  
but a place to land—  
as all falling stardust must  

and you are cold  
and you are shivering  
sitting on a wide beach of white sand  
the wind with its job to do  
your vigil is aside  

the three quarter and clouded moon  
looking down on you  
shines white light that is  
a secret from the sun bounced  
‘round the solar system  
and  
there is no one else watching  

but you who’ve come  
this late at night  
for the show that  
goes on for almost forever  

That will be all for you, Rausch.
