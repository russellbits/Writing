I wrote until I couldn't keep my eyes open. Even that wasn't enough. I've written until I can't anymore but because I know what's at stake, I need to keep going. For the reasons that Rasuch has given me—for fifty thousand words—I must keep going. It's exhausting. fifty thousand words is so much; it's so much to say and I've nothing to say. I write critiques; does that matter to you? Call me out, Rausch! Stop terrorizing the things I love! I have nothing more to say, I think. I will type until my fingers bleed, Rausch. Kids have come and gone for Halloween and I can take no part in their happiness because of you. I just don't know what to say about myself. I'm no one to pay attention to, Rausch. Please, please, give me back what you have taken.

To the Universe I say, please understand that my manuscript (if I could call it that, really) it's a plea for help. Are you reading this? Please help me. This is not an exercise. I'm not writing fifty thousand words in the month of November because I want to. I'm doing it because if I don't then Rausch will... well, I'm not exactly allowed to say what he'll do. I can say that if I don't create fifty thousand words by November 31st, Rausch will destroy my life and everything I love. I do not want to do this. I have to do this. I do not not not want to do this (that was good; repetition is good) I have to, have to, have to do this. Fifty thousand words or [insert threat].

What can I say? His rules are sitting here on my desk next to this laptop. I cannot report them. Although he did say I could paraphrase some elements of it for the story—for the reader: you. Why he cares about what you're reading here, I've know idea. No. I HAVE no IDEA. But for whatever it's worth to you, you should know, Rausch has given me stipulations—the things I can do—must do—to keep him from revealing what he has in his possession, to keep them safe.

Basically, it's all I can do to write. I must write this novel. I do not want to. I write under duress. And, I can't tell you what he is doing to force me to do this. I can't even hint at that. I suppose it would lead to his undoing or being found out. I'm putting up every one of these writings on the Internet so that everyone can see my progress. I need to write sixteen hundred a day. A DAY! It's an immense objective. But Rausch is watching. He said that I have to give him his five thousand words every three days. He said nothing about posting those writings publicly. So I am going to. Maybe somebody knows who he is. Maybe someone can help me. I suppose the three day limit thing—I suppose that's almost kind of him, because I might wait until the last minute—writer that I am—to meet the deadline. Deadline. That's never been so true for me. Dead line.

That is something I wouldn't mind in the least, except that... well, I can't say. Obviously Rausch cannot be found out—or his identity cannot be known—or his true persona can never come to light—or his real nature should not be scrutinized—or his description cannot come to light? And let's face it, Rausch is not his name. Well, this repetition is only going to work for so long. HOLY CRAP! I have to write sixteen hundred words a day at least! It's just not the way I write. But of course—of course? — Rausch knows this. Somehow he knows this. I think this must be personal.

He must know how much I care for the carefully constructed sentence, but he also knows that I don't go in for a carefully constructed plot.[^1] I want precision from my sentences. If you give a shit about a sentence, you don't write it once. You write it, by hand, on paper, over and over until it's write [no edits! more words! sic] right. I think that's the way Nabokov did it. Didn't he write his sentences out on index cards and then just re-arrange and re-arrange them until he could type up a page? I have no idea where I get this shit. I just pick this information up and spit back out as fact—except I'm telling you it's just anecdotal BS. Believe it if you like, but you don't have to believe it. But, didn't Nabokov write about an analyst hunting down a poet in “Pale Fire”? I never read it, but I think in one of my graduate classes I was supposed to. (I ended that sentence in a preposition just for you, Rausch.) I wonder if you're going to read this text or just keep fucking with me so that you can have what you really want. I don't think this text will have anything to do with what you want in the end. I don't know who you are, but for some reason I feel like I know what you really want. You won't get it from me.

Look, this book is being written in distress. (Or maybe not. For some reason I feel centered today.) But, under duress... believe whatever you want about the next 50,000 words. I mean, of course I'm going to have to make up a bunch of shit just to get through this and I can't even tell you why. I might think I know who you are, but I've got to think that whoever you are, you just simply won't do what you've threatened me with. I beg you.

I suppose I could tell you why from a certain point of view. I could tell you about what lead me to meet Rausch, and considering that he wants an apology, or some kind of acceptance or forgiveness—whatever he wants—I could tell you how I came to know him. I guess I could waste 50,000 words on how I got here, knowing Rausch, and why he is making me do this. Being in this situation—typing for my life—I suppose I am somewhat responsible.  It's awful. You can't hear the clicking of the keyboard. You can't hear the terrible silence that exists when I'm not typing. It's... it's... well, it's just some occasional raindrops outside on a metal roof and those god damned raindrops aren't making words are they? I guess they are, seeing as how I just wrote about them. But they aren't noises like the keys being pressed that are getting me out of this situation.

Good Lord, I have to regroup. I have to take a break. How many words is this? Jesus, the program I'm working is just some little text editor. I mean, there's no word count. I just started typing because, I've go to, and if I work in some sort of word processor... I can't take on the risk that the whole thing will just be erased. I've got to work in text. This is about word count. This is about word count! (I know that strategy is limited.) But still, I've got to have numbers. There's no way out of this for me; it's a novel or no novel that is 50,000 words. I have no choice. Rausch has got me by the balls. So, here's a novel, I guess:

Uh, once upon a time there was an asshole who threatened… something… my *heart*. How’s that Rausch? You said I couldn’t mention what you were threatening, but am I mentioning it if I use a metaphor? You. Are. Threatening. My *heart*. And I hope you are reading this come Monday because I will get you your God damned 5000 words every three days this month until I hunt you down and murder you with my bare hands. You *read* me, Rausch?—with my bare hands. And then I’m going to print this piece of shit, delete it, and *burn* it, you son of a bitch.

[^1]: Incidentally, I know Rausch knows these things about me because he goes on at length about it in his ransom letter. I've no idea how he knows these things about me. It's frightening really. It's more frightening for someone to know that then if they knew my credit number or license plate or home address. And there were other details about my writing—things that he knew. I think with a few more clues I could figure out who he is. I just need to figure our where to get those clues.
