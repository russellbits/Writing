The thing that I hate about the dreams that I'm having lately is that there just is no control.[^11] I can't run correctly; am constantly burdened with deep mud or the wrong size shoes, or sometimes my legs feel like they are just asleep (which they technically are!). So much of it has so little to do with Rausch, other than maybe he's my target or someone I am vaguely hunting. Then again, it must have something to do with how powerless I feel right now to solve this problem; especially after not catching his damn courier yesterday. But I'm incompetent in every single dream that I'm having lately—the ones I can remember.[^12]

I'm decent at that. I can remember dreams and I often write them down in journals. My investigations into dreams have illustrated to me that it matters what you saw a day or two before. I have dreams about explosions often after I've seen one in a movie theater. I've never seen an explosion in real life. Some part of me doubts this; thinks that there is an explosion just tucked away in my cortex, or whatever part of the mind is responsible for putting these experiences we have away in to cubbies in our neurological weavings.

Strangely, if I've never seen an explosion, I have felt the awesomeness of it in my dreams on a number of occasions. The beauty of being in a dream is that you can stand directly against the force of an explosion if you know that the threat only exists in your mind. I throw my arms up in front of my face and brace and the explosion washes over me like nothing. I often do this. I've seen US cities just blown apart, only to stand in front of the explosion in total hopelessness for the city but not for myself because I know this is a dream.

This is part of the benefit of writing down your dreams when you awake from them. In the dream, you begin to get hints that the room is not right; that it feels familiar and yet can't be because you recognize none of it. One dream I had was of a wood workshop—something I have indeed dreamed of having—the sawhorses were all hung from the ceiling upside-down. In the dream I pushed one of them and it swung and I knew I would never construct in such a place, but there it was "before my eyes" and I began to suspect. I woke up inside of the dream.

I can not explain how gratifying it is to wake up inside of a dream. At first it was because you were free from the constraints of this world. But as you get older and have more varied dreams it begins to become a recognition of the fact that even *this* life is a dream. It's all a dream. I have no idea whose dream, and I do not care. I just know that I can become lost in my mind.

Becoming lucid—as they say—in your dreams—recognizing that it is a dream, something must be wrong. In order for something to be wrong in your dreams, you must first know what is common and right in your life. I have heard some lucid dreamers say that you must look at your watch at the same time of day every day. It seems reasonable. It has never helped me despite the fact that I often look at the clock when it is 9:11. I was there in New York on that day, and I did not experience anything but the aftermath. But I still see the clock at that time (either in the morning or afternoon) more frequently than anyone could call an accident.

The clock is just never what wakes me up in a dream. For me, looking at my feet is what does it. I spend some time looking at the menu in a fancy restaurant with nothing but little people in bowlers coming in is the only scene and I can't read the menu. The characters on the page are nothing more than a dancing of ink that refuses to become anything literate. I can tell the difference between the name of a dish, the description of the dish and the price of the dish, but beyond that I can read nothing.

Look under the table though, and I see my feet, and suddenly the realization comes to me obviously. My feet are there. They're not too far away. They're no oddly dressed. It's not that they aren't my feet. They're just not where they're supposed to be. And then the dream has a tear; one I can peer through. I look around and there are the little people in bowlers and I realize I've never been to this restaurant; never with this particular crowd. And then I realize that the restaurant itself is made up of details I've only seen elsewhere. It's a mad conglomeration.

From this particular dream I am thinking of, there is grass on the floor instead of tile. The entire ceiling is draped in such a way that there is no way to see the actual ceiling. The draping just drifts in layers and layers until there is nothing for them to anchor to and the draping is all there is. There is no ceiling. Realizations that there are no ceilings are troublesome. They tend to convince you that the whole scene is unreal, and if you manage that, you wake up.

Last night, I had a truly bizarre vision. I was with a number of people who were hunting an adversary [^13] It was raining. It may have actually been raining outside from what I saw the next day. But we were hunting. And I had much more than a .38 snub. I had a massive automatic rifle. At some point the hunting party was invading a massive base made mostly out of concrete and I had to duck down beneath a partition of concrete that was barely four feet over my head. I am happy to skulk through mud if need be, but what came next was frightening. With an open road off my right shoulder, I was crawling-dragging myself through this rain gutter when a passenger bus pulled up next to me—it's familiar hiss of brakes following it's arrival.

Then, as it arrived, inches from me, the bus drop a knife-sharp, three-pronged, fork-lift front like a portcullis in some medieval castle, just inches from my hand. Through the absolute pouring rain I am trying to see the man who is driving the bus with a fork-lift on the front of it. He's a blur in the driver's window, maybe waving me through, maybe waving me away. If I get this wrong, I'm dead. I want to run in front of the bus, and tread so carefully past the tongs of that massive fork. But if I start running, will it just grab me? I wave him by again and again but he won't move the bus.

I go to run, and I wake up, reaching around everything in my bed to physically understand if I am even upright or not. My iPod is lodged underneath me. It takes minutes for me to lie on my side and grab my breath. Rausch is a shadow in the back of my mind—certainly the man driving the bus-fork-lift hoping to wave me into his path.

[^11]: This, I think, directly corresponds to my new (and unpleasant) involvement with the FBI. They, the cavalry, have been called in. I am glad for it and they have given me every sense of satisfaction that there is no way that Rausch could be aware of their involvement, but I am still set aside as some sort of useless consultant for information. I won't be the hero in this scenario.

[^12]: I'm especially incompetent when it comes to my own case. While I was off at the first drop off for Rausch, I had no idea that Smythe wanted to see me because he'd brought in the FBI. I might not have taken the chance that I did if I'd known he was going to bring in the heavy guns. He did. I met and shook hands with Agent Samantha Cobb and her partner Agent Peter Caravale. What threw me off was where the questions went. Where was I all day yesterday?

    I repsonded that I was at faculty meetings.

    Samantha responded that, given that she was the FBI, they had come to the University to find me. Maybe I didn't think it was more important than grading papers; she did. Of course, she pointed out that there were no all-day faculty meetings, and this is what I had suspected I would have to confess to the local detective, but not the FBI. It didn't matter; there was no way out. I confessed. She was none too pleased. And that's when things took a bad turn.

    She said, "The day your wife and child were kidnapped, you say you weren't at your house. No one she had asked could find you at the University before at least 3:00pm. Where were you all day?"

    I said that I tended to work at the Library and not the office so that I wouldn't be disturbed.

    Agent Cobb asked me what I was working on.

    Friday? I was grading papers. I don't think I was, but I panicked.

    Then Agent Cobb said, out of nowhere to me, "Why do you resent your wife?"

    I sat in shock. I don't resent my wife. I said as much.

	"We're on your side, but we are also trying to work off of evidence. We know why you lied about not being able to meet us yesterday—you were at the 'drop-off'," she used air quotes. I probably made a disgusted face.
	
	"I *was* at a rendevous with a man that Rausch hired."
	
	"There was a courier."
	
	"Was there really?"
	
	"Yes! He was a dark-skinned man in a pea coat and hoody."
	
	"You gave him a USB disk? What was on it?"
	
	"Drivel. Nonsense. Rausch said—"
	
	Caravale chimed in, "We know what his demands are. But other than some wacky letters you gave us, there are no phone calls and no way to initiate contact with this guy."
	
	I pointed out that wasn't true. The one thing I had thought to do was to print out the email that Ruasch had sent early that morning—his first god damned criqtiue. I gave it to them. I pointed out that if he's reading what I'm writing and writing critiques then I can deliver messages.
	
	While Agent Cobb read the email, Agent Caravale asked, "What's to keep us from believing that you didn't right this?"
	
	"The adddress he's writing from—I don't know what it is and whenever I write to it, it bounces back. It's like it's one way or something. But look into it; whatever it is, whoever owns it, it won't be me."

    She said something like, "Look, You're not in too bad situation right now." Then she smiled at me? It was a terse smile; is there such a thing? "This will all get better when you start telling the truth—the whole truth." She put her hand on my shoulder and rubbed it. I admit it was comforting.

    I told her I was trying to get Rausch for myself. Then, I started tearing up. "I want him dead!"

    She removed her hand.

	Agent Caravale stepped forward and said, "You hid some of the ransom note from us."
	
	I said, through tears that I just wanted to find the bastard.
	
	Agent Carvale said, "Yeah. We get it. This guy is a new one. But we're gonna get him. When's the next time you're supposed to meet?"
	
	I told them. November 6th.
	
	Agent Cobb asked, "Have you written anything?"
	
	I just looked at her with black holes in the center of my irises. Have I written anything? Have I written anything to save the lives of those who I care most about? Have I written the way that I am being manipulated into doing? Then I lost my temper. *Of course* I have *writen*! I have *written* day and night as if it would magically conjure up my God DAMNED family! I have written until I couldn't keep my *eyes* open. I have been fighting Rausch all by myself and the only weapon I have is words that I give him—words, by the way, that are painful to create and only then stolen in the end. Have I *written*. Yes. And Rausch has it all—everything I've written to date, he has.
	
	The agents sat and added me up. Then, Agent Cobb said, "Let's go over all of this from the very beginning."
	
[^13]: Dreams are always fuzzy things; I'm the first to admit. But a word like "compound" sticks with you even when you wake up. I believe that memory is mostly about salience of connections in your memory. The halls in your dreams are semantic connections and when you wake up with a word like "compound" in your memory and can't remember thinking of the word for the last several days, it's because your mind has made some kind of semantic connection. In your dreams, you're reviewing experience from the past day (or several days) and your brain is trying to "solve the problem." I put "solve the problem" in quotes because I have no idea what the problem is.

    In this particular case, I actually when through my journal entries from the previous several days and just saw no indication of what I was observing, no mention of the word compound. I even searched emails from the previous few days for the word compound. It did not appear. I'm not mystical about these things, I just think that in this case, the word "compound" had something to do with the problem I was trying to solve. But, also at this particular time, the only problem I was trying to solve was getting my grading done soone enough that I could get home in time for dinner.
