# Glossary

Cyclopedia, The
: A large device (of unknown type) that can tell you most things about the Archelux. It is essentially considered a user manual for the world.

Extravision
: Some beings ability to see into more of the electromagnetic spectrum than normal light, or the ability to see heat, or the ability to see into the Quode dimension.

Idex Automata
: Evo's creation. Unlike Enki's design, the Idex Automata can use energy from the high plane, but it does so by tunneling into the lower plane and adjusting quode at a microscopic level. Able is built around an Idex Automata which gives him the ability to manipulate Obtala in any way he sees fit.

Logicanth
: A manipulation of the nanosphere that results in a change in the world.

Qubit
: A device made up of crystallized nanosphere. Very hard to construct, but it can be found at the center of most quodecraft-based lifeforms. For some reason, not Able.

Quode
: A force in the universe that can imbibe an inorganic thing with will.

Quodecraft
: The art of constructing things out of the nanosphere. For something to do more than be a repetitive machine, it requires a Qubit.

Macrobots
: Namely, Nip, Po, Ka and Tet’s the Vim.

Nanosphere
: The tiny machines that exist everywhere in the world, in the air that can be used to manipulate the physical nature of the world as well as construct macrobots.

"Remory’s Guide to the Archelux"
: A book by one of the original council members that describes the Western Hemisphere of Ur.

Sul
: A force separate from Quode that generates time and replication with mutation. One could consider Sul similar to entropy and without it, things would simply repeat forever.

Texo compass
: A device that can hone in on a target from anywhere in the world by firing a laser toward it.

## The Species of the Archelux

### Synthezoids
An ancient race of machine people, synthezoid beings were constructed tens of thousands of years ago. Although they were manufactured and not intended to procreate, they are actually the first children of the Shattered Land. Though synthezoids possess the ability to construct others of their own kind, how synthezoids function is lost to time. In fact, they are daemons of the world, but because the original Koders of Warnel abandoned it, the daemons had little left to do but maintain the world and when the First Council formed, there was only left for them to obey the council. So they did. And when the council failed, they wandered and most disappeared.

### Nomex
The nomex are the most common sentient creatures in the world. However, they range in color and appearance. The nomex of the Idex Mortez tend to be dark skinned with dark hair, while the nomex of Boisneval, for instance, are tall and very thin and have very light-colored skin, pinkish to blonde to gray hair and bright blue, green or purple eyes.

### Myconoids
Underground dwellers, the Myconoids, without their biome, are very tall (2 meters) and very thin and haveno eyes. They grow lichen and mushrooms on themselves (referred to as their biome) for sustenance and protection.

### Dustmyn
Similar in size and shape to nomex, the dustmyn live on and around the Silt Sea, their capital city being Hasnasfresis, a city built on the back of a giant, ancient (long dead) silt tortoise. They are small in stature (~1 meter) and grow their hair in long, thick bushels that collect silt, protecting them both from the sun and wind on the Silt Sea. Their hair is generally brown or blonde and their eyes usually gold, but they are rarely seen without significant amounts of obscuring clothing such as goggles. They are quiet and fierce.

### Chimexapods
Large mantis-like insect people who live East of the Inverted Mountain. They generally stay in their territory, but in recent times, for some reason, they have been encroaching on other lands.

### The F'myn
_(F'myn is really pronounced like wind in the trees, but not really possible for other races to speak)_ There should be a people like the Fynn, a tree people, but I'm not sure how to get them into the world since there aren't really forests anymore. Maybe they're extinct and the crew only finds out about them through some holodeck-style interaction. Or maybe, they've developed incredibly intricate green houses, much like Ghendra's and water to them is more precious than gold. They have programmers that can make it for them at great cost.

### Aaraamyn
A vulture-like bird people. Their capital city is the floating city of Uchava. Their culture is very Japanese-like with a great appreciation for design and for things to have longevity. They are largely content to live in their floating houses and cities and ignore the lower world. They have maintained lots of greenery and agriculture by being higher in the atmosphere where there is more light and more oxygen.

### Krunmyn
A large people (4 meters tall on average) with very rocky skin and large mouths. They live on the silt sea opposite the Dustmyn and are on generally friendly terms with them.

## Time

Ern - Dustmyn notions for hours.

## The Story Circle

1. A character you can identify with
2. The character has a wish or need that is unfulfilled
3. The need or wish causes them to cross a threshold
4. They go down a road of trials
5. They are searching for something and find it (like it or not)
6. That discovery kicks their ass
7. They come back to the world they started in having gone through trials
8. Having changed


Understanding, or at least manipulating the CODE is the unrealized boon!
