# Chapter 31

## In which the crew sees the first Dur'la

"Regardless of where that contraption is pointing, we cannot directly follow its line. We can curve—follow along the line, but not on it."

Captain Ona Soireé, Gef, Nicole and Wacamolo were standing in the navigation room of the Craft Siltmere. Rather than maps and charts, as the Captain was used to, Po was occupying the center of the navigation table and drew a new three dimensional map of the area surrounding them as well as the line which the Texo Compass had traced the night before, after the ship had set out. The line of the Texo Compass passed through the Eye of Sa-ah.


Nicolle spoke, "Forgive us, Captain Ona. We don't even know what this Eye of Sa-ah is. Please explain."

"The Eye of Sa-ah! How can you not know?" But the Captain put her head in her hands and took a moment to breathe. These outsiders of the Sea seemed to know so much more than her, and yet nothing at all. She sighed and spoke, "The Eye... it is a storm that hovers over the Silt Sea. Once in its grasp, there is no escaping it."

"Yes, souer, we—I know of the storm," spoke Xistra.

"Do you, souer? Do you? I have seen it and there is no trade you could offer to get me near it." Ona thought and then spoke, "I had no idea who you were, even with Alharih's letter. No one. Goes. Near the Eye of Sa-ah. The currents of the Silt Sea are made of her. We sail glide around her."

"I'm not from around here," said Nicolle. "Why don't we begin with you telling me what this Eye is?"

Ona looked shocked, and then said, "It's the great drain."

Nicolle looked to Wacamolo, "What's that?"

Wacamolo spoke, "Po, what is the great drain?"

Po reacted by throwing up a hundred diagrams in languages no one around the table understood. Angles and calculus were precisely drawn, efficient vectors drawn; everyone around the table was lost. Wacamolo shrugged, "I think Po is lost."

Nicolle demanded, "What about Remory? I thought you had memorized Remory's Guide?"

Wacamolo was defensive, "I have—as much as this old Nomex can. It's as new as Delphine's Scar. It's new!" Wacamolo's shoulders fell. "You've been so protected by Vivian, Nicolle, don't you see this is the Shattered Land? The world is falling apart. Who knows why the chimexapods attacked the Steppes? This is the Archelux now."

Nicolle put her hand on the old nomex, and as she did, Gef saw her. She spoke to the old nomex and said, "I didn't say it was your fault, and I'm not mad that you don't know. I'm frustrated. We all are. Any answers you can get out of Po are worth our time. It is Po."

The Captain, still stern, looked at Nicolle and said, "Kinder quodecraft than me, Princess."

Nicolle's eyes grew sharp like crashing, cutting waves of lavender silt, and she said, "I go where my scientist, Vivian the Terrible, wants and to not witness my travel is a danger to you. Call me princess again and regret it."

"Hallo," shouted Able loudly.

"What is this?" asked the Captain.

"What, Captain? Who. The very reason I am here and Po and nIp and Ka'rolly and Nicolle and Xistra—those who changed Kvet, stopped the massacre of the South. What? Captain? Try who."

There was silence in the cabin.

"Did I interrupt?" asked Able.

Gef stepped in,"We have to traverse the belt of the Silt Sea; there are storms. What's that take?"

Wacamolo spoke, "I thought you didn't know this area; what belt?"

Gef put his head in his hands, "I don't know... belt."

The Captain spoke again, "We must—" and then entire glider lifted into the air, and they all fell into darkness.

There was nothing to knew. This were minutes where Able could exercise his ultra vision, else that matters. It was hanging on to a piece of the Craft WHya? Staring looking for Rilla outlizing anywise that it could and comp,,, thinking thinkngi who: what where was the wave of 

Po, Nip Ka.

Po arrived first. Po "explained"—none of it made any sense...

Nip arrived next. Quick hover, quick halo, quick seat. "Thank you, Nip!" One more thought, and many others. Rilla, of course. This thinking thing, this thing of thing this thing where I am.
