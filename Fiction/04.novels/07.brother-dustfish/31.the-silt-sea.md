# Chapter 31

## In which the crew sees the first Dur'la

Able stood at the bow of the silt-glider with the first mate, a Krunmyn named Huck-ta. Try as he might, Able could not tell the difference from the Silt Sea and the sky—there was no horizon, no... anything. There was just an undulating shift in color.

"Regardless of where that contraption is pointing, we cannot directly follow its line. We can curve—follow along the line, but not on it."

Captain Ona Soireé, Gef, Nicolle, Xistra and Wacamolo were standing in the navigation room of the Craft Siltmere. Rather than maps and charts, as the Captain was used to, Po was occupying the center of the navigation table and drew a new three dimensional map of the area surrounding them as well as the line which the Texo Compass had traced the night before, after the ship had set out. The line of the Texo Compass passed through the Eye of Sa-ah.

Nicolle spoke, "Forgive us, Captain Ona. We don't even know what this Eye of Sa-ah is. Please explain."

"The Eye of Sa-ah! How can you not know?" But the Captain put her head in her hands and took a moment to breathe. These outsiders of the Sea seemed to know so much more than her, and yet nothing at all. She sighed and spoke, "The Eye... it is a storm that hovers over the Silt Sea. Once in its grasp, there is no escaping it."

"Yes, souer, we—I know of the storm," spoke Xistra.

"Do you, souer? Do you? I have seen it and there is no trade you could offer to get me near it." Ona thought and then spoke, "I had no idea who you were, even with Alharih's letter. No one goes near the Eye of Sa-ah. The currents of the Silt Sea are made of her. We glide around her. It's the great drain."

Nicolle looked to Wacamolo, "What's that?"

Wacamolo spoke, "Po, what is the great drain?"

Po reacted by throwing up a hundred diagrams in languages no one around the table understood. Angles and calculus were precisely drawn, vectors pointed everywhere across the map, everyone around the table was lost. Wacamolo shrugged, "I think Po is lost."

Nicolle demanded, "What about Remory? I thought you had memorized Remory's Guide?"

Wacamolo was defensive, "I have—as much as this old nomex can. It's as new as Delphine's Scar. It's new!" Wacamolo's shoulders fell. "You've been so protected by Vivian, Nicolle, don't you see this is the Shattered Land? The world is falling apart. Who knows why the chimexapods attacked the Steppes? This is the Archelux now."

Nicolle put her hand on the old nomex's shoulder. She spoke to the old nomex and said, "I didn't say it was your fault, and I'm not mad that you don't know. I'm frustrated. We all are. Any answers you can get out of Po are worth our time. Still," she turned to the group, "Where are we to go?"

The Captain, still stern, looked at Nicolle and said, "Kinder quodecraft than me, Princess."

Nicolle's eyes grew sharp like the crashing, cutting waves of lavender silt, and she said, "I go where my scientist, Vivian the Terrible, wants. To call my travel naive is a danger to you. Call me princess again and regret it."

Wacamolo and Gef exchanged glances. Neither had seen Nicolle so fierce.

The captain raised her hands in apology.

Nicolle said, "I'm sorry." She brushed her hand across her forehead. "It's been days and..."

"No apologies necessary," said Captain Ona. "This is what the Sea does to you." She looked around the navigation room at everyone. "There is nowhere to look, no horizon. It feels like you're sitting still in a room with no end. The cloud of silt even ruins the stars."

Everyone in the room was silent in agreement.

"We should make a straight line North as fast as possible," said the Captain. "We cannot follow your friend's line."

"Hallo," shouted Able loudly.

"What is this?" asked the Captain.

There was silence in the cabin.

"Did I interrupt?" asked Able.

"This line to the Ultracircus, Master Able," said the Captain. "We cannot follow it."

"Oh," said Able.

Gef stepped in, "We have to traverse the belt of the Silt Sea; there are storms we have to avoid."

The Captain spoke again, "We must—" and then entire glider lifted into the air, and they all fell into darkness.
