### A New Able  

Able awoke as though surfacing from a dream composed of fractured mirrors—images reflecting and refracting with little concern for sense or order. The remnants of his memory clung to him like cobwebs: the shimmering chaos of the Automatic Jungle, its ever-shifting vines of silvery goo; the immense automen that patrolled the Cullen Mountains like ancient guardians; the brilliant flare of the Delphine Meteor, streaking through the heavens as though searching for something it had lost. But these memories were entangled with visions of things he could not place—a vast, spiraling vortex suspended in the heart of an impossibly large cavern, and an inverted mountain, hanging upside down as though the sky itself had chosen to wear it as a crown. The mountain seemed to draw the gaze of everything, as if the whole world tilted toward it.  

When he opened his eyes, Able found himself standing high above the ground, on what appeared to be a pedestal carved from a single block of lustrous black stone. He blinked and gasped as he looked around. Beneath him, on a gleaming table surrounded by machines that hummed and blinked like mechanical fireflies, lay a figure. Able squinted. The figure was... him.  

Or at least, it was someone who *looked* like him, if “he” had been a hollowed-out statue. The body on the table was ashen and lifeless, with a gaping hole where its chest should have been. Strange instruments surrounded it—gleaming rods, tiny pincers, and blinking consoles—but they might as well have been wizard’s tools for all Able could understand of their purpose.  

“Ah! You’re awake,” said a voice, brisk and cheerful. Able’s head turned—slowly, as if it were not entirely under his control—and he saw a figure standing not far away. For a moment, his heart leapt. “Gef!” he tried to call, though his voice felt trapped inside him, reverberating through his chest like the toll of a distant bell.  

The figure stepped closer, revealing a face so like Gef’s that Able’s mind struggled to reconcile it. But this was not Gef. Where Gef’s features had a softness that suggested warmth, this man’s face was sharp and bright, as if sculpted from ivory and polished to a high shine. “Not Gef,” the man said, his tone amused. “Tet. You’ll find me quite different.”  

Able blinked and tried again to speak, his words fumbling free at last. “What... what is this?”  

Tet gestured expansively, his hands sweeping through the air as though conducting an invisible symphony. “This, my dear Able, is progress. You’ve been upgraded—improved, you might say. You’ll find your new body to be stronger, faster, and far better suited to the challenges ahead.” He pointed to the figure on the table. “That old thing? Consider it retired. You, my friend, are standing at the dawn of your true potential.”  

Able stared down at himself—his hands, his feet, his legs—and saw, to his astonishment, that they were no longer his own. His arms were thick and metallic, his hands vast enough to crush a boulder. He flexed his fingers and saw the gleam of cyan light ripple across their surface like sunlight on water. He looked up at Tet, his voice trembling. “But I didn’t ask for this.”  

Tet shrugged, his grin undiminished. “Of course not. Nobody ever does. But you’ll come to see it as a gift. For now, take a step forward. Let’s see how you manage.”  

Able hesitated, his gaze darting down to the pedestal and the dizzying drop beneath it. “I’ll fall.”  

“You won’t fall,” Tet assured him with a laugh that was light but carried an edge of impatience. “These new legs of yours are far too sturdy for that. Trust me.”  

Swallowing his fear, Able lifted one enormous foot and placed it carefully in front of the other. The pedestal didn’t so much as wobble. Encouraged, he took another step, then another. The ground felt strange beneath him—solid, yet with a faint hum, as if it were alive.  

“Excellent!” Tet clapped his hands. “See? You’re already a natural. Now, come and have a proper look at yourself.”  

Tet led Able to a tall, mirrored column that shimmered faintly, reflecting the room’s many lights like the surface of a still pond. When Able peered into it, he saw a towering figure with broad shoulders, glowing cyan eyes, and an aura that pulsed faintly like a star on the verge of going supernova. The face looking back at him was his, and yet not his—it was too clean, too precise, like a drawing brought to life.  

“I look... different,” Able said softly, touching his reflection as though it might speak back to him.  

“Better,” Tet corrected. “Stronger. And you’ll find it quite necessary for what’s to come.” He placed a hand on Able’s massive shoulder and gave it a reassuring squeeze. “There’s much to do, my boy. Much indeed. But first, we’ll reunite you with your friends. After all, no adventure is complete without them.”
