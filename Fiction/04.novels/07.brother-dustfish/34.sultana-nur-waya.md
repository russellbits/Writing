# Chapter 34

## Sultana Nur Waya

Able awoke from strange dreams. It was to think of them as dreams, though, some we so real. There were rough sketches of things he had actually seen, like the grey goo of the Automatic Jungle, the giant automen of the Cullen Mountains, or the Delphine Meteor. Then there were scenes of things he didn't think he had seen. There was a massive vortex of some kind, floating up inside a very large cavern. There was a mountain that had been turned upside down.

Able blinked and looked at his surroundings. He was high up on a pedestal, one of the first things he saw was himself. He could see he whole body standing on a table with machinery around him, lights and switches and... there was a massive hole in his chest!

When he had seen himself before, in reflections, he had been covered in a vibrating light and his eyes lit up. From here, wherever here was, his body not only had a massive hole in the abdomen, but his eyes were gray—his whole body gray. He looked dead.

But then his vision came around to someone in front him. This person was working on something near him at first, but then looked up and said, "Ah! It looks like you're back with us." As the face came into view, it was Gef! "Gef!" said Able. Only he didn't. He went to speak but nothing came out. "Just a moment," Gef replied. There was more work and then, "Try again."

"Try what again?" This time Able could hear himself on the inside *and* on the outside. This made sense. "Gef?" Able asked again. The person working on him stood up to his full height and was still looking up at Able, "Not Gef. Cal."

"Cal?" Able began to see the room take shape now. Beginning with himself on the table, surrounded by machines—like the ones he had built for his mother. He hadn't thought about that in a long time. Then, he surveyed the room to see lots and lots of these machines, some that towered over him and hid their tops in the high dark ceilings of the room. It looked like Ghendra's place, a laboratory. The whole room was filled with bits and bobs and things that looked incomplete.

"Are you still with me?" asked Cal.

Able focused again on this Cal-who-was-not-Gef. "Where are my friends?"

Cal smiled. "They are quite nearby and very much enjoying themselves. I can show you if you like, but I need you to do something for me."

"Okay."

"I want you to take a step towards me."

Able tried to contemplate this. He was above this Cal, looking down. "I'll fall."

"No, no. You won't. Maybe it would help you first if you looked down—at your feet."

Able looked down, the height still unusual, but sure enough, his head looked down his torso, his waist, his legs and far beneath him, his feet! Able blinked several times. He was so high up, but there he was. He held out his hands in front of him, and there they were, but they were huge. He made fists and then let go. He looked down at his feet again and moved his feet. They moved but they seemed so, so far away. Still though, he took a step. He felt wobbly, his head like a balloon.

Cal held up his hands, "Okay, just finish with the other foot and then stand. See how that feels."

Without knowing quite why he did it, Able squatted down, so he was at the height he was use to, his head at Cal's stomach. Able looked up at Cal and squinted. Cal looked just like Gef, except for the way he moved. Cal was more deliberate, less like water than Gef. Able stood again and felt the world around him move swiftly down, and even Cal, who was the same height as Gef, came to be beneath him. Able looked at Cal, "I don't understand."
