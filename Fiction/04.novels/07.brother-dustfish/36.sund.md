# Chapter 34

## Arrival at Sund

Rilla sat atop Ableâ€™s new massive shoulder and it felt wondrous and strange. His new body was reassuring in many ways to her, potentially a protection, but then Able was so disoriented. They had discovered that Sulcata Nur Waya was the name of the fortress and that, actually, the name of the Silt Sea turtle itself was an enormous mouth full: Hada Makhan Jenjenyen Basel el Zogann. Her name was known only because it was written in some historical texts by the people who built Sulcata Nur Waya. Even Tet said he was not able to communicate with her yet. Nonetheless, she responded to commands from the bridge, again, for reasons unknown to anyone.

As Able and Rilla had made their way around Sulcata Nur Waya, Able kept bumping into to door jambs and banging his head on beams. It was clear he was not used to his new size yet. They explored as the giant Silt Sea turtle made its way to their destination: the city of Sund, the city of bridges.
