# Chapter 34

## Arrival at Sund

Rilla sat atop Able’s newly augmented, massive right shoulder and it felt wondrous and strange. His reconfigured form was an assurance in ways to her, potentially protection. He felt like a tank. Yet Able’s hesitant movements betrayed the lingering disorientation that seemed to plague him since the transformation. In that way, she pitied him. In their wanderings through the ornate, carven halls of the floating fortress, there were times when a simple door posed a perplexing puzzle to Able. He would set Rilla down with care and then bend and turn and squat to pass through some portal. Occasionally these efforts were met with a dull clang as he hit his side on door jambs or his head on overhanging beams. At other times he would duck and turn at some broad archway when it was clear that such actions were not at all necessary.

“Able, you didn’t even have to put me down. There’s plenty of room.” Rilla would chide.

At these admonishments, Able would stop and look at his hands as if they belonged to someone else and then he might look wistful at Rilla and murmur, “You’re so small now.”

In their wanderings, investigating with Po, they had discovered that Sulcata Nur Waya was the name of the fortress and that, actually, the name of the Silt Sea turtle itself was an enormous mouth full: Hada Makhan Jenjenyen Basel el Zogann. Her name was known only because it was written in some historical texts by the people who built Sulcata Nur Waya. Even Tet said he was not able to communicate with her yet. Nonetheless, she responded to commands from the bridge, again, for reasons unknown to anyone.

They explored as the giant Silt Sea turtle made its way to their destination: the city of Sund, the city of bridges. They found themselves on the bridge with Tet, Gef, Nicolle and Ka’Rolly. The bridge was situated in a bubble halfway up the foremost tower of Sulcata Nur Waya. From the orb of glass, one could see far to the horizon of the sea in three directions. Nicolle pointed out to them how fast Hada could move because the Skybow had already thickened out quite a bit from when they had been at the equator near the Eye.

Massive, dark cliffs had begun to rise up from the horizon north as well; the Cliffs of Hallokargin and the southern border of the Krunmyn lands. Tet, looking at the cliffs, spoke, “The Cliffs of Hallokargin are famous for their fjords.”

“What’s a fee-yord?” asked Able.

Tet turned away from the view to Able and Rilla (still perched on Able’s shoulder like a bird), “Fjords are massive chasms that cut into the land from the sea. They are very deep, which is good. We will be able to approach Sund quite close before we need to disembark.” Turning back to the window, Tet continued, “Sund actually used to be two cities on either side of the largest of the fjords, Krazackjord. There was Sundxi and Sundla. Because of that, there were many bridges that crisscrossed Krazackjord. The cities collapsed some time ago—“

“During the Breach,” said Gef with some consternation.

Tet stared at Gef for a long moment. “Yes. During the breach, the cities collapsed and the populace largely now lives on the bridges.”

Nicolle asked, “Why go to Sund?”

Tet answered, “It is still a significant trading hub. We will be able to gather supplies for our trip north to Uchava.”

Nicolle continued her inquiry, “And what’s in Uchava?”

“In Uchava, we will be able to acquire an airship.”

“An airship!?” declared Rilla.

Tet smiled at her enthusiasm. “Yes. Able, would you be so kind as to have your Po display the Ultracircus again?”

“Sure.” Able took Po out of his cozy belt pouch and rolled him on the floor toward the bridge’s navigation console. Po, with a chirp, dutifully displayed a light sculpture of the lumbering Ultracircus, crawling through the air but going nowhere.

Pointing at the light sculpture, Tet explained “The appendages of the Ultracircus are nearly 1000 meters in height. The city is, of course, meant to be impenetrable. We must approach it via the air. And though we now have the means to locate it, we do not know who occupies it, if anyone at all since the council dispersed.” Tet paused. “That’s another reason to go to Uchava as a matter of fact. I am hoping to find Erra.” Tet looked to Gef to see if there was any recognition, but Gef’s face remained blank. Tet sighed. “Erra was the Aaraamyn council member. If she is in Uchava or nearby, she may have more information about what we will encounter when we approach the Ultracircus.”

Nicolle spoke, “The only scientist from the council we’ve managed to find is of course my dear Vivian. She’s who-knows-where now. And then, Able knew Evo. What makes you think that this Erra will still be... around?”

Able looked at the ground, a profound sadness in his heart, hearing his mother’s name again.

Tet placed his hands behind his back. “Frankly, I don’t.” He rubbed his forehead. “It’s been nearly a hundred years since the breach and I have never managed to find one of the council members. I can certainly account for ht fact that Enkiset is gone.”

“Who is Enkiset?” Asked Rilla.

Tet smiled a withering smile. What no one knew in this room could fill the fortress itself. “He was my master. Gef’s as well.” Tet shot Gef another sharp glance. Gef shrugged. “He was, in some ways, the leader of the Council of Scientists.”

Nicolle folded here arms. “There was no leader of the Council of Scientists.”

Tet replied, “Let’s just say that while many of the council members were content to do nothing about the Breach, Enkiset took action. If you knew Vivian so well, you would know that she assisted him.”

Nicolle looked quizzical. “She never said anything about an Enkiset.”

Squinting, Tet examined Nicolle. “Strange.”

The group stood in thought.

“Regardless,” continued Tet. “The plan remains. We disembark at Sund, gather what we need for a trip North to Uchava, get an airship and then find the Ultracircus. Are we agreed?”

Nicolle and Gef nodded. Able just said, “Sounds good,” to which Rilla added with almost a cheer, “Sounds fun!” Tet smiled at the child, but knew, in his heart, there was no going to be much fun about it.
