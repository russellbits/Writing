# Chapter 34

## Aboard the Living Island

Tet and his entourage led the crew into the bowel of Sultana Nur Waya, a massive castle that sat on the back the turtle Shume. Tet explained to his guests that the turtle was not even the largest among those that swam in the Silt Sea, but for whatever reason, the ancient people who built the keep convinced Shume to stay at the surface. Most turtles dove below the surface and did not come up again for hundreds of years. Shume was more accommodating, though no one could say why.

The keep’s ceilings and archways were as tall as the museum of Trees back near the City of Horn. They were golden and lit but some unseen sources. The archways and columns were covered in a rich green moss that was surrounded by small flying orbs of light. Able could feel that the entire place had moisture in the air. The moss dripped with dew that would gather into intricately carved, small etchings in the walls and as the dew thickened and traveled down the etchings, it would pool in massive urns set at the bottoms of each archway they passed through.

Able also watched Tet’s “guards.” They all were the same embroidered cloak that Tet was wearing, but where Tet had removed his hood and pulled the cloak back from his shoulders, his people remained shrouded, their eyes bright yellow. They had a very unusual gait, almost heaving with each step. They also each made a unique and unusual subsonic sound that only Able and Gef could perceive. At one point during the tour, Gef and Able exchanged glances and Gef just shrugged.

With his hood off and his cloak off his shoulders, all of the crew could not stop staring at Tet. The best way that Able could think to describe him was that Tet looked like a newer version of Gef. Other than Gef’s scratches and blemishes and wear, the two were identical. Tet was waxing on and on about the keep. He had surmised that it was built by the Krunmyn people, possibly five hundred years earlier, but they had abandoned it for thus far unexplained reasons. The texts that were available were written in an ancient form of the Krunmyn language—frankly, the Krunmyn barely wrote anymore anyway. Tet had been working on translating them as part of his many studies.

“Po can help with that,” Able offered. Gef winced. He wasn’t at all sure what they should be telling this supposed brother.

“Pardon?” Tet asked.

“I said Po can help with that. He can read anything.”

“Tet looked around the group. And who is Po?”

Able pulled Po out of a pouch and held him aloft. Po made a series of chirps.

“Po, you say? May I examine Po?”

Able pulled Po a little closer and replied, “You’d better not. He also likes to eat memories.”

“He does what now?”

Nicolle spoke, “We’re not sure how exactly, but he can absorb nearly any kind of information and that includes an individuals memories.”

Tet stepped back. “Well, that certainly adds to my list of questions for all of you.”

Just then, Nip left Xistra’s neck and spun in a halo around Tet’s head, making a blat sound.

“Oh my,” said Tet.

“That’s Nip,” said Able.

Tet watched the Nip spin and put his hand to his chin. “So many questions. Unfortunately, friends our tour ends here.”

The tour group had arrived at a massive octagonal room with no ceiling. The walls stretched up through the center of the keep and through the hole in the roof, the Skybow of the Goliaths could be seen, though very thin this near the equator.

Tet’s entourage dissolved, their cloaks falling to the ground. In place of each “person” were pairs of floating glowing orbs connected by many rods surrounded by glowing clouds of dust. The dust immediately swirled around each member of the crew with the exception of Nip, who immediately screeched and flew up into the heights of the chamber. The dust clouds froze each of the crew in their tracks, lifting them off the ground.

“As I said, I have many, many questions, and in the interest of my own safety, this is how we must proceed. Like your Nip and Po, I have the Vim. You have just met them. They will keep you safe while I proceed with my investigation. We will all speak very soon.”

The crew members looked at each other in horror as they shimmered and then disappeared.
