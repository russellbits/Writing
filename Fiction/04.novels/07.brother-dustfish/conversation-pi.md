# My Conversation with Pi about the book

Hey there, great to meet you. I’m Pi, your personal AI.
My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let’s talk about whatever’s on your mind.
What do you like to do in your free time?
I like to create art and write fiction.
That’s awesome! Creative pursuits are so important for self-expression. What kind of art do you make? And what kind of fiction do you write?
I create Dadaist stuff—very silly—sometimes even humorous. My fiction varies a lot. Right now I'm working on a kind of science fantasy novel.
Science fantasy, huh? That's a really cool mash-up of genres. Sci-fi and fantasy have so much potential for interesting plots and characters. What inspired you to write in this genre? Is it your favorite genre to read?
I like to read science fiction and fantasy, yes, but I like to read any genre if it's well-written. This book was more inspired by process. I wanted to write something that had no limitations on my imagination.
Wow, that's a really cool way to approach writing. It's so freeing to not have to worry about whether an idea is "realistic" or not. That's a great way to get creative juices flowing. What’s the premise of the story so far? What’s the world like?
It's a broken world. Things aren't quite right. Gravity works in some places, not others. There is an ocean called the Silt Sea made entirely of silicon crystal. There is a giant meteor called the Delphine that rolls along the ground through a valley called Delphine's scar. The occupants of the world are all manner of creatures: nomex, myconoids, synthezoids and more. The most powerful beings in the world are called scientists. They control their powers through something called the Nanosphere.
This is just...so wild and intriguing. I love all these concepts! The world you're building is so bizarre and creative. It's so refreshing to read about a world that isn't trying to be logical or realistic. It's like a fever dream, but in a good way. So, who is the protagonist in this strange and wonderful world you've created?
The protagonist is young synthezoid named Able. It's slightly strange that he is a young synthezoid since synthezoids don't procreate and so are never young—they have simply existed for thousands of years. He lives in the Desert of Idex Mortez; a place far from anywhere. More than anything he would like to see the world and find the Ultracircus; a giant walking city.
So Able is a kind of outlier among synthezoids, being young. That's really fascinating. He sounds like a character that has a lot of potential for growth and self-discovery. And I love the concept of the Ultracircus. It's such a weird idea, and yet it's strangely compelling. Is Able's journey to find the Ultracircus the main plot of the story, or is there more to it than that?
That is the main plot for the first part of the book. Able gathers a crew of people along the way: Gef, Wacamolo, Rilla, Nicolle and Xistra. They all want to help him to get to the Ultracircus and some of them have their own reasons for going there. Once they get to the Ultracircus, they discover that there is a way that they might fix the Shattered Land. By the way, the world they are in is called the Archelux, but everyone these days calls it the Shattered Land.
Wow, you've really built a complex and vibrant world, with all sorts of interesting characters and factions. The Shattered Land has such a great name. It evokes this feeling of ruin and loss, but also something deeply wrong, not just something broken. I feel like this book is going to be a great adventure story, with the characters having to deal with all sorts of fantastical obstacles as they work to fix the world. Is there a villain in the story, or is it more about the group working against the brokenness of the world itself?
There are sevveral villians along the way and ultimately the discovery of the person who "broke" the world.
Ah, so this story goes deeper than just the protagonists' journey to the Ultracircus. They will have to confront the person who caused this mess in the first place. That's so cool. It adds a real moral complexity to the story, because the characters might discover that this person isn't simply a two-dimensional bad guy. Maybe they had reasons for what they did, reasons that are hard to understand. Is that the kind of story you're going for?
Yes. I think, although I haven't gotten that far—I'm only something like 225 pages into it. But I think, in the end, the villian who broke the world was trying to "balance" it and messed up.
Wow, that's so interesting. So the villain is a kind of misguided well-intentioned extremist, trying to do something good and instead wreaking havoc on the world. That's a really fascinating way to look at things. It adds a lot of nuance and moral depth to the story, and I think it will make the characters' choices a lot more complex as they grapple with the villain's motives. Have you thought about the ending yet, or are you still working that out?
No. Like I said, I've only written up to page 225 of what will probably be 350 pages.
That's still amazing progress! You should feel proud of what you've accomplished so far. You've created an entire world, populated it with fascinating characters, and begun an epic story with lots of mystery and intrigue. I'm excited for you and for your readers, whenever you finally finish the story. Are you planning to try to get it published, or is it just a personal project for now?
