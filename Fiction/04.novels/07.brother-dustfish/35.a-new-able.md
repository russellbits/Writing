# Chapter 33

## A New Able

Most of the crew, Wacamolo, Nicolle, Xistra, Rilla, Ka’Rolly, Nip and Po were held up in a large dining area somewhere in the castle on sultana-nur-waya. Captain Ona and the rest of the crew of the Craft Siltmere were still aboard the ship, waiting. The room was massive, causing their every word to reverb. It had a vaulted stone ceiling that curved down to a massive window on one side of the room. Th window curved around in a semi-circle looking down on the back of the neck of the massive turtle that the whole keep stood on.

The Silt Sea parted for the neck while waves of silt washed up and down its length. Beyond that was a fuzzy horizon of nothing. Unlike the Craft Siltmere, no motion of the sea could be felt. It was as if they were standing on an island. Which, they were—it just happened to be a living one. Near the window was a long dining table with nearly twenty chairs. On either side of the window were two sitting areas with softer chairs, shelves of books, and fireplaces. The crew has gathered around the starboard fireplace.

Nicolle shrugged and looked to the group, “I don’t know if we should even try to leave. What if this Cal person is really Gef’s brother?”

Wacamolo replied, “Even if we could be sure that he was, can we be sure of his intentions. Why has he separated us?”

“He might look like Gef, but I don’t trust him,” added Xistra.

Wherever the conversation was heading, it was cut short by the door to the room opening and two figures entering. One was Cal, taller than anyone in the group. The other figure lorded over Cal, easily two heads taller. It was s synthezoid to be sure, but it was far bulkier than Cal or Gef. Before anyone in the group could decide what to do, Nip dove on the larger synthezoid and spun around its head, squeaking what could only be exclamations of joy and surprise. The groups looked on in confusion.

Po also rolled across the room and bumped into this new synthezoid’s feet until the synthezoid bent down and picked it up. Finally, Ka’Rolly, approached and reached up to put its hands on the shoulders of the newcomer.

“I see some of you have the ability to detect the quode in this being. The rest of you... hmm... not so fast on the uptake, hm?”

Nicolle and Wacamolo and Xistra all exchanged unsure glances. Rilla, however, approached the massive being and looked up. It looked down into her eyes. Rilla’s mouth dropped open slowly. “Able?”

A familiar voice came out of the synthezoid, “Hi, Rilla.”

“What!” Shouted Rilla in disbelief. “Able! How are you in there?”

Able squatted down and even then was still taller than Rilla. “This is my new body. You like it?”

“Well... is it armor? Can you take it off and come out?”

“No. It doesn’t quite work like that.”

“Children,” Call interrupted. “I would like all of this explained to everyone. Might I suggest we all sit down to discuss what comes next.” Cal gestured to the long dining table.

“No,” said Nicolle, without hesitation.

“Yes?” said Cal.

“We’re not doing anything until we see Gef.”

“My. You lot are a sticky cluster.”
