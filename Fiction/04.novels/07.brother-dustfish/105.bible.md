## In the Beginning...

In the beginning there was the High plane of Unix created by the first maker, Sym. Out of the high plane, the great rainbow Goliaths (among them Grep, Maya, Tun, Git, and Vi) the first children of Sym, came and constructed Obtala, and with it, two forces: Quode and Sul. There were many rainbow Goliaths, some who never contributed to Obtala and deigned to watch. Two in particular were Nil and Enubys, (sometimes called the Ungods) who strove to drain Obtala of all its time and organization.

The lower dimension, Obtala, has many worlds and the world in which the council began is known as Ur (more recently, the Archelux). But after Enki's experiment, it became known simply as the Shattered Land since all energy and organization was being drained through the wormhole at the center of the inverted mountain.
