title: A Letter from Josie
---

Before I have the chance to tell Agent Cobb about what I found this morning (the bunch of letters from ages ago) she hands *me* a letter. She looked apologetic, if that's possible. When she put the opened letter in front of me, she looked down. There's no doubting that, despite everything else I doubt. She said, "Read it."

So I did.

> Dear Allen
>
> This is all they have given me: a pen and paper. They've told me nothing about what to write. They just said to write you. So I am. As ridiculous as this sounds, it reminds me of another time that I wrote to you. Do you remember? We used to write. We have those letters. Keep them somewhere safe, Allen. I don't know what these people want. I know that they want something from you. They keep telling Anna and I about how special you are. The thing is, Allen, what they want from you is strange. I don't understand it. They say certain things constantly, like, "It is decided." They say that often. They say "Without witness there is nothing." And, though they have looked after Anna and I in a careful way, often when we ask for something, they still reply, "It is decided." Allen, what is this? It doesn't matter. All I want to tell you is that Anna and I are fine.

> They don't believe that you will believe that we are okay, so I am supposed to tell you something in this letter that is secret. I am supposed to say something that only you and I will know. So I am saying Synchronicity and the Jungian Shadow. Do you remember that night? We stayed up all night to discuss the idea that the Jungian Shadow had to lead to synchronicity later in our lives. I can't think of anything else, Allen. We connected that night. We knew that we knew the explanation for all coincidence. We knew why we saw it, and why we looked for it.

> I've no idea what this is about except that they told me to write this to you. They also told me that you would know how to get Anna and I back to you. I don't know but to ask why you know the things that these people want. But, if you have any idea, I hope that this gets to you. I hope you know what is going on. I hope that you are okay and safe. More than anything, Allen, I hope that we will be together again. I know what you think about the world and patterns and such and I know you think this is some random atrocity, but it's not, Allen. Something has gone wrong in the world.

> Whether you see that or not, it doesn't matter to me. I love you. Right now, I'm waiting for you, but at the first chance I get, I will get Anna and I out of here, and we will find you, and whatever else occurred before this awfulness; we'll forget it. We'll move on. We, all three of us, we'll just go anywhere. Anywhere but this awful, awful nightmare. I suppose they've told you about the writing nonsense. I can't suppose you're doing it, but then, maybe you are. Write anything, Allen. Write anything. These people are mad. Anything might make sense to them. Write anything. It doesn't matter.[^33]

> I won't leave you. I won't leave you even if they take me. And Anna—she's not scared, Allen. She's been with me and she's frightened, but she's with me. I don't want to die, Allen, but... I love you and Anna, of course, loves you. I can't ask for you to do anything for us but what you can do. But if something should go wrong, if something... I don't know what. This is strange, isn't it, Love. Just know that I love you, Anna loves you. Nothing changes in the future. We love you for always. I just want you to know that for now we're safe and we love you, Allen. I've always loved you, Allen.

I look to Cobb; she shrugs. I become angry. "How long?" is all I can say.

"Today," she replies.

"All of this time and someone finally delivers me something that my wife wrote?"

"It showed up in your mailbox this morning, Worthington."

"And you know what it says?"

"Yes."

"And are you prepared to do anything about it?"

"Yes."

"..."

"We expect Rausch to explain a rendezvous similar to earlier ones—not to far off the M.O. You'll be there. You'll have your phone—we've been instructed in regards to that. We'll be prepared."

"Will you really?"

"Yes."

"It's been ahead of both of us all this time."

"Still with this 'its' bullshit?"

"Let's go to the car."

"I haven't even—"

"I don't have time for—let's go to the car."

"Fine."

In the car, outside the house, I reach into the pea coat and pull out the batch of letters that I've collected. "I've no idea if this is anything, but then I haven't thought that anything so far has been anything. Ezra Enoch." I hand her the batch of letters.

"C'mon, Worthington. This is just more misdirection. You're just absolutely full of shit aren't you?"

"Was that letter from my wife? Did it match her handwriting? Was it mailed? Was is time-stamped? Can the FBI figure out where the hell that letter was mailed from? Just curious, was I anywhere near that mailing and time stamp? Because I *wasn't*."

"You're good."

"I'm not good; far from it."

"Have you even gotten a signal from Rausch today?"

"It's coming."

"How do you know?"

"Rausch knows something about time and consequence. I know they do."

"Now it's 'they'? You just can't stop can you?"

I show Agent Cobb the email and say, "I wanted to be in the car because I think *they* are everywhere. I know for a fact that they got to Paul Nolan. They can get anywhere they want to."

"HOW did they get to Paul Nolan?"

"Listen, it doesn't matter. Today, you're going to lose even me. READ the email!"

She does. "And so what? You go off with them? Whatever elaborate plan they have, you're not getting away from the FBI to become some additional unsolved case."

"It's not unsolved. Ezra Enoch! He wrote me. Find him."

"You're volunteering for this?"

"It's my bet that I won't volunteer. I mean, the second drop off..."

"Fuck you."

"Okay, but."

Samantha ties her fingers around the steering wheel. Her knuckles go white. "If I let you go, I've got nothing but this stupid name to go on."

"It's enough," I say. "Also, Hormirzad—there's a city called Hormirzad. I don't know why, but it's important to them."

"This is just your getaway isn't it, Worthington?"

I look Samantha Cobb in the eyes. "I swear on my wife and daughter's life that this is not an attempt to get away with anything. I just think there's a damn good chance that this is going to happen whether we like it or not. Maybe if I'm closer to them..."

Samantha Cobb sighs; puts her head on the steering wheel. "That was your wife's handwriting..."

"Indeed."

"There's no way to plan this."

"There is not."

"There is one thing we can do."

[^33]: I can't figure if Josie wrote this letter or not. It's her handwriting, but seeing as how I've been coerced to write, perhaps so was she. I suppose it doesn't matter in the scheme of things. Rausch must have thought that there was some incentive in it. Their plan has been disrupted a few times I think; especially by the death of Paul Nolan. The time of the letter must have been some aspect of a plan that has since been upset. Why receive the letter now? Why send a letter that gives no proof of life? Surely, Rausch could have posted a video online somewhere if what they were after was to keep me going.
