    Subject: Re your first 5000 words  
    
    Allen,    
    
`Allen. Dear Allen, of course I expected to be disappointed by your first outing. I retain no malice for it. I expected the first 5000 words (one tenth of what I am asking for) to be somewhat amateur and lazy. You could have used the moment to absorb yourself completely in what is happening to you. You could have looked at your life and seen an opportunity to escape it, not what you seem to be writing about: reflection encouraged only by self-pity.`

`And, I respect your unwillingness to call this a game. You are right to identify the cliche in the phrase "What's his game?" No human is a game; any human is a wash of motivations. This event, if you will, is not a game. It is an exercise. Let's change your motivation. This *exercise* is meant to make you more than you, by yourself, can actualize. You are, after all, more than you claim to be; more than one person. You keep many people inside. You have incredible potential and I intend to bring it out of you. What you know is deep and necessary. You do not know why. But you have seen something inexpressible beyond the beyond and I intend to drag it out of you.`

`You should not bother laying me out as the adversary here. It won't do you any good, for one. I have planned this for a long time and you won't find your way out of my maze. But you need to understand that I am *with* you, Allen. I want to see your full potential, and I've created the perfect situation to manifest that ideal version of you that you can't seem to accomplish on your own. You must write something holy for me.`

`Your first five thousand words (with the exception of the story about the gas chamber) they just were not surprising. Of course you would focus on yourself instead of the greater cosmos.`

`Definitely don't repeat yourself going forward—unless for some unforeseen reason it is a device that really can assist the story. Copying and pasting is cheap and you know it. This, whether you like it or not, *is* a story. I've put you in a treacherous position and now I have also given you the opportunity, through my unique ransom, to capitalize on it. And I want you to have the opportunity to tell this story. By the end of this, I will win, and I will publish this work from you. You will have nothing to say about it. Many will read this work in its final form, and they will know something true from it, precisely because *you* have written it from desperation.`

`So do not embarrass yourself. Make an effort here. It will matter. No one knows more than I why this exercise matters and what is at stake. You are the instrument. You must finish the game with honor, and that honor will only be constructed from your best efforts.`

`That all being said, there were a few shining moments here in your first effort. At moments, you describe your surroundings and how they compare to how you are feeling. These are elegant, but I am more interested in those moments when you lose yourself; shed your identity. Yes, some great stories are written in 6 words. That is true. But those sorts of stories operate under a rule, like: write a story in six words. It is a challenge. Your story is to be 50,000 words. That is *your* challenge. In fact, I do not even care if you take the whole 30 days or not. Finish early; you will still win back your prize.`

`The gun purchase was brave, maybe even comendable, but expected. Consider that it resulted in the most interesting part of your attempt at writing something towards the True reality. I did feel the cold steel of the weapon you had purchased—I felt it in the palm of my hand, too, Allen. I felt the *passion* which might have caused you to pull the trigger—not that I will ever be foolish enough to give you that opportunity, nor would I think that death would arrive so short-sightedly. But, this is the sort of succulent narrative I am requesting from you. Still, this gun, it is not the story.`

`I have given you very few rules by which to operate other than to say that I want you to give me a story that is 50,000 words long (at least) by 11/30 and that it that has Truth and heart and feeling. Give me the deepest thoughts that you have. Be honest about who you really are. So far, I think you do not appreciate the spirit of the exercise. Do not make me create a list of rules; play by the spirit of the exercise. Rules make everything so boring. Rules make novels boring. Rules harness creativity; they do not birth myths. Write me a story, or if you prefer a Bible. Do not repeat yourself. Stop using contractions; they're sloppy, even in a novel. Besides, doing so only benefits your word count, you know.`[^7] `Obviously, do not copy and paste like you did in that horrid first 'chapter'. I am looking for the best in you. I am doing this because I care. I hope that you can understand that.`

`You should know that I need what it is you write.`

`Do not be lazy about this, Allen. You know what is at stake. Give me the whole of the religious nature of all the games that you play. Your little game in the park is one of a thousand outcomes I have already designed around. It is ridiculous to think that you know where the whole of the universe is moving like a tide. You are surrounded. You are on the inside without concept of what you've begun. No sudden massive wave will beat me at this. You may thrash and cry, but you must complete what I want finished, for both you and I to know who we are. I demand the original story you began with. The place you started. The place, that even you know, you did not begin. You are important and you know it. You will give that over to me for the simple reason that you cannot handle it. It must be the original story, but it also has to be one from... the heart as you have taken to saying. I will keep my end of the bargain. As long as you turn in 5000 words every three days, the game`[^8] `is afoot and I will not hurt what you love. But you must try harder to tell the story I want. Tell the original story. This counts.`

`I will text you again on Thursday.`[^9]

`Rausch`

[^7]: In "Session" 2 I mentioned that there were a few things about Rausch that were starting to give me some clues as to a possible identity. For one, in his original ransom note, he knew crazy things about me. I can't go into to too much detail, but he definitely knew intimate details about the way I write, definitely what I write. He knew what I liked about the books I liked. That gave me a decent short list of people to start thinking about. But that bit about contractions? That is a major, major clue—especially to be so smug about it. I really have to check my evidence (my hunch) before I go into to too much speculation. But I really do think I might have a line on who Rausch is; even why he might do something as perverse as this.

[^8]: Extremely telling. Rausch goes round and round about discussing this as an exercise, one designed for me. And yet, in a moment of... revelry?... arrogance? he says "game." Maybe he's being sarcastic, but I see no way that there's any trusting this man. Even in his demands, he in no way is revealing his true plan here, and I have little doubt that it means the loss of my... the loss of my whole life. That he uses the word 'game' here is some indication of something that I need to know about him. He doesn't mean it when he says this is an exercise. He had something else in mind; some kind of psychotic picture or poem. He has a certain end in mind. I don't know that it involves me ever seeing again what I hold dear.

[^9]: So then, the question becomes: if this is not an exercise and it is a game, what is the game?  Something dark in my heart says that the only way he wins his game is if I go through this gruesome "exercise" and then he destroys me anyway. He said that he had designs on publishing the book. How could he do that without my permission and under these circumstances? This is the worst of plots and it is the one I need to commit myself to happening. While he's still in control, while I have no clues to who he is, I have to assume the worst of all possible outcomes.
