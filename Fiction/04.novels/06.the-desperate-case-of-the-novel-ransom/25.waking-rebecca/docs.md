title: Waking Rebecca

His guards pick me roughly up from my seat and lead me behind him to another part of the house downstairs; two floors to a basement. There is a room of beds laid out like a hospital with twelve people sleeping while being fed some sort of drug from IVs. I speak up, "What is this?"

Ezra looks at me and says, "These are those seeking you—well, your better half. Look at their faces. Don't you recognize any of them? Haven't you seen them in any of your panicked nightmares these last dozen days? They are well-trained. For months now, when they were not dreaming, they were at and near your house. They found you to begin with; only you will not speak to them in your dreams. As long as you have insisted in being Allen Worthington, they have been asleep and looking for you, or wherever Reza has tucked himself away in that mind of yours. They are seeking Reza Bahadir—any traces of him that they can find. When we wake them, they write."

He leans over and picks up a journal off of one of the decrepit nightstands. He flips through it and stops,

>The hallways are disjointed and seems to run on forever. There is no access to the outside. The hallways, even when they have doors, only open on classrooms with no windows and no one in them. I look for Reza but can only see other dreamers.

He looks up.

I stare.

"Do you doubt?"

"I don't... I don't think that's..."

Ezra continues to read:

>When I do find Reza, I try to show him my journal. I tell him that everything is there; every place I have searched; every idea about him that I've had. He scoffs at me. He only ever leads me away from the book. He makes me read it and the nonsense on the page and his laughter wakes me up."

The hair on my arms stands on end. Did I write that dream in the book. I couldn't remember. Suddenly my weariness, the lack of sleep, washes over me. I realize that I've been running on adrenaline since this morning. I stammer, "Y-y-you could have made that... you could've written it."

"You're right. Let's do this instead. Charles," Ezra turns to one of the men in the room overseeing the sleeping—comatose—individuals, "let's wake Rebecca up."

As the man Charles begins to fuss with Rebecca's IV, Ezra walks to another part of the room and drags a wooden chair loudly across the concrete floor. Ezra turns to me and smiles, "Don't worry. They won't wake up." He leaves the chair next to Rebecca's bed. "Come here. Sit."

I instinctively can't move. My handlers practically pick me up by my arms and push me to the chair and sit me in it forcefully.

Ezra gestures to Charles for something and is handed a small vial. From the opposite side of the bed, Ezra passes the vial under Rebecca's nose. "Come closer," he says to me and my handlers lean me in over the bed, close to Rebecca's face.

As Rebecca's eyes open she rolls her head back and forth on the pillow. She seems to make out Ezra's face first and stops to linger on him and a groggy smile twists across her face. Then, she rolls her head again, looking at the ceiling and then to me. Her eyes open wide and dilate. "No," she says. "No." She looks around the room more forcibly, trying and failing to push herself up from the bed, "Am I back? Am I back? How is he here? Have I been lost! Please! Please! Wake me up! Wake me up! Please wake me up!"

Ezra leans over on her and pushes her weak shoulders down easily as she breaks into tears, mumbling "Am I awake?"

He says, "You're awake. You're not awake. It doesn't matter, Rebecca. You've done it. You've found him. Look at him. There he is. And he wants to tell you something, Rebecca. Look at him."

She looks at me with eyes wide and wet, desperate to hear something. I need to say something to calm her. I try to recognize her, but I don't. Regardless, I say, softly, "It's me, Rebecca." I cast a glance at Ezra who is trained on her. "It's Reza, Rebecca, and you're safe."

She goes from a panicked, tearful stint into a more quiet sobbing, still clearly confused.

We return to my room, at the top of the house. My handlers let me sit myself on the bed. Ezra had gone off to fetch something else. I sit and stare at the walls, thinking about that poor girls face. Without thinking about it, I ask the guards, "Did they ever do that to my wife or daughter?"

One of the guards coldly considers me and after a long moment shakes his head.

"Okay!" says Ezra, bursting through the bedroom door. "Now on to step two." He's carrying a tea tray with a coffee mug on it.

I can't help myself, I start to stand, but one of the guards make to stiff-arm me. Still I shout, "I'm awake! There's nothing to look for! I am not Reza! Even if I was Reza, I am not asleep. When I am asleep, I'm not Reza! You're just torturing those people down there."

"Calm down, Allen. For one, I don't intend to do that to you. There would be no purpose in it; you've not yet convinced me that you are willing to search. But I believe I have other methods—other methods that Reza Bahadir talked about."

Ezra continues, "You see, Allen, what you think is that you are not Reza. I am not terribly interested in what you think. I am interested in what you dream. But I am willing to do two things. One, to put you into a waking sleep, and two, to give you what these explorers have written. I think that will be enough for you to continue and finish what I've started—what we've started—what Rausch started."

"You're going to drink this." He points to the coffee mug.

I respond, "You have me. You have my family. I'll give you what you want, but you must know, you misunderstand Reza's theories. What comes next, you cannot expect. This immortality that you seek; it is not what Reza sought. He wanted immortality in the *moment* and what he found was immortality in Limbo and he didn't want it and I'm telling you, you do not want it. You do want it!"

"I DO WANT IT! I made a church for him! I re-built a temple for him! I brought his greatest disciple to his knees and I want what Reza knows and I will have it!"

I sigh, hang my head. "Fine. Give it to me. I give up."
