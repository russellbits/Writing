Synopsis
====================== 

As did with Carousel Cowboy, I'm despensing with the whole chapter structure, and need to focus on the flash fiction that makes these four (five?) threads unite in some sort of climax.  So far, the threads that interest me most are the FBI agent

The most powerful thing that anyone who wanted to know/understand the mind would be possession of someone who had telepathic abilities.  I think this puts Coburn on center stage.  The government (Frank Black) wants him.  Science (Reid Richards) wants him.  Religion wants him (maybe thinks he can communicate with the Constant--and maybe he can!).  He's a weapon but he's also a threat to each of these institutions.

Part I - The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Have - You DId It To Yourself

We open with the attack on the artificial island.  Art terrorists hang glide on to it and write graffiti for the copyright liberation front.  There is an investigation and as there have been a number of crimes, the FBI is called in.  A. Croft Black shows up, head of a special domestic terrorism squad.  Ian Fleming, on his way to work, sees the Dr. Z poster.  Jacob is hearing much of this on the morning news before a jog.  Jason runs into Jess the next day and they discuss that things are getting dangerous for the group�she wants to get lunch.  Someone meets a member of the Church of the impermanent condition and is told about M. Kane Maddock.  Gene Copeland is being called by "The System."�that whole speech.  Noh is going over the exit strategy.  There is the first transcript from "the guys in the van."*

There are also various phone conversations, radio broadcasts, commercials, emails, etc�all revolving around our storyline�the first art terrorist attack.

Then,


This first part has to establish all the various kinds of delusions/illusions that the brain is under.  [] indicate what is to be unlearned in the course of the book.  Coburn operates and puts on "The Show" and acts like an ass and a god.  He gains his powers right toward the end of part one and gets taken away by Frank Black [learns that he his not god and comes to understand the misery/suffering of the human condition by looking into Even's mind].  We witness Zolifex indoctrinating members into the Cult of the Impermanent Condition [It's really a nihilist group and he will learn that he is not a god and be confronted by the Constant].  We see Gene in the midst of the machine, the system [He eventually becomes a Buddhist and enlightened].  David Arrow is an advertising exec who is the master at persuadnig people to buy what they don't need "It's not about quality--it's about recognitino!"   He thinks he is so masterful at the art of advertising that he can advertise and make people desire everday common things. [He realizes that advertising is shallow?  Meaninless?  True happiness does not come from coveting other's material possessions and filling gaps and holes in your life.]  We see Elsa and how she and Jason meet and their (Elsa's fame) [Elsa's fame eventually begins to tear her apart.  Jason keeps her together.]  We meet Frank Black who's idea of power is secrecy and encryption and the like.  Some of the characters, like Ian and Travis, and joining "characters"--they kind of drift through the book without any of this conflict/learning nonsense.  In fact, I'm cutting Travis entirely.  He didn't end up in New York.  Ian did, though, to his surprise.  And he's friends with Jess and Elsa and Jason.  Burt Gonnevut is in all this a a linking character as well, bringing the "Shattered Land" into this story in the same way that Even and The Constant bring "Just Moments After Science" into this story.

Part II - The Zero Code (There's some underlying experience that we all share--must share and understand that is the onyl thing--that the ego is an illusion)
  Maybe this whole thing will work itself out in two parts?  There needs to be more intermingling of characters.  Coburn appears as a crazy homeless man relying on the help of Burt Gonnevut (I think both of these guys later on show up in "The Hugner Engine")  So, in other words, in which it is revealed that disparate minds speak the same *real* language (the language of perception)  Coburn rallies himself to fight against Frank Black.  Gunn gives over to a more naturalistic artform and marries Elsa (who gives up her modeling career).  Reid Richards begins the AI revolution that will lead to "Just Moments After Science"  David Arrow creates the ultimate advertising campaign (Artwork appears all over New York.)  Coburn runs into Evena and the Constant from the future. (This part may not be in the book.)


Notes
====================== 
What's the overall plot?

There doesn't have to be an "overall plot" so much as something that is tying everyone together besides the theme.  I like the idea of writing about New York as a giant brain (as opposed to the creature description in the Hunger Engine--evolution?)  There is the mad scientist story that I originally conceived for the Hunger Engine.  Maybe Jacob Coburn distributes the RFID prions in the water?  Or wants to?  Maybe he does so with the unwitting help of the Copyleft Liberation Front (CLF)--who are well-meaning but ultimately a little lost (i.e. burning out-of-print books and distributing free copies of copyright books).  Or is this something that Frank Black wants to do because they will be able to monitor everyone's thoughts after that? (Much better motivation--and spooky)

Some underlying "threads":

"Chimps Typing Shakespeare" (?)

"It's What's For Advertising": Nutso creative director who engages in an advertising campaign to advertise really mundane things.  This happens early in the story so that weird advertisements are always in the background.  (Chronologically, but maybe not)  This thread contains design history concepts and debates about aesthetics.  It might be good to weave Elsa and Jason into this one.  By mundane things I mean: definite articles, wearing underwear, legal tender: "Everyone agrees"�ad that stipulates that metropolis living is different from suburban living.


"The Memory Thief": The neurosurgeon who becomes telepathic.  (It is his discoveries that later lead to The Constant's ability to switch minds with Even Fleeting via molecular sized RFID)


""

Thread 3: The computer programmer who believes that people are just machines�the extreme skeptic.  Solipsism is this extreme degree of skepticism with regard to minds.  he includes himself in this bunch.  Everyone does what is expected and his self-built Beowulf cluster allows him to calculate their actions and reactions (he uses emotions as noise and calculates them out and then works out probabilities for behavior)  Part of this belief about computers as machines also leads him to write a book called "Installing Buddhism" in which he talks about how Buddhism is a different framework for how the human brain operates (lots of opportunity to site Jeff Schwartz's work here).

 
Thread 4: The cult leader who creates a group of suicide bombers to attack media institutions in the belief that they are controlled by Zhargon (The Constant), some kind of robot god from the future (heh heh)

Hypnosis needs to be part of this Brain->Wash

I should mention Banapana just for completely vain reasons. Phbbt.

All of these characters have some aspect of mind as their goal.  Jason wants to work with art by sharing his mind.  Frank Black wants to control other people's minds.  Jacob Coburn, the memory thief, etc.  The organizations and themes should revolve around this too.

THEMES:
Intellectual Property -- ownership of the mind
Philosophy -- what is the mind?  The materialist view, the quantum dualist view, the anti-realist Intentionality view
Media -- the extensions of the mind
Art -- the mind in aesthetic form
Drugs -- The mind all fucked up!
Mysticism -- the antimaterialist view

METAPHORS:
Hives
Zombies
What's the "brainiest" fruit? --walnuts?
