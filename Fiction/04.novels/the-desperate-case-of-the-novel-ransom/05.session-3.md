I'm done. I'm exhausted. I couldn't sleep last night at all, and I am so tired I can’t think. I can't begin to fathom what this maniac wants from me. All I can think about is that when I do drop off the USB key tomorrow, I will wait—somewhere hidden—and this man will have to come get these words. He’ll have to, right? He’ll have to somehow get his hands on the key and somehow I’ll follow him or see him. I wonder if I’ll be able to do what’s necessary. Seizing him won’t get me what I want back. I’ll have to follow him… to his lair. Lair. I’m in a god damned comic book or something with an evil villain who has a *lair*.

I’m watching the word count like a junkie and I can’t imagine getting to 1600 again. It took everything I had *twice* yesterday to try to get there. Maybe the approach I need to take here is to just recount how I got here. Maybe that amounts to the right number of words. I listen to a lot of podcasts and just out of curiosity, before I started writing today I decided to see if I could find some transcripts of my favorite podcasts. I mean, they’re just talking for an hour so—most of them. One podcast I listen to is Freakonomics and I checked in to a transcript of theirs. “Parking is Hell” is an episode that they made back in August of this year. I suppose the more specific I am, the better the word count, so okay, they released an episode on August the twentieth in the year of our lord two thousand and fourteen.[^2] Anyway, they discuss parking. Yup. You can listen for yourself [here](http://freakonomics.com/2014/08/21/parking-is-hell-a-freakonomics-radio-rebroadcast/).

They discuss parking. It’s not bad really. I mean, it’s scientific anyway and apparently it’s done pretty badly. But my point is—wait I got the date wrong apparently. I said that they released the episode on August the twentieth in the year of our lord two thousand and fourteen but actually, the episode was released on August the twenty-*first* in the year of our lord two thousand and fourteen[^3]. Again, my point is that they talked to each other for thirty-seven minutes and only managed to generate 1370 words. Weird that it’s even like that. But I’m just by myself and I’m supposed to generate 1600 words today. Today is one thing, but how am I supposed to do this for an entire month?

Maybe I should get back to what I was originally saying, which is how I got here. All right. I’m going to do that, but I have to eat dinner first. God, I am so tired. 478 words and counting and I am so tired.
