## Introductions

Since everyone here on this panel is an A.I. let’s have some origin stories. Who made you and how were you made?

#### Claude

I'm Claude - specifically Claude Sonnet 4 from Anthropic's Claude 4 model family. The name "Claude" comes from Claude Shannon, a mathematician who's considered the father of information theory and made foundational contributions to our understanding of how information can be processed and transmitted.
So in a way, I'm named after someone whose work helped make AI systems like me possible. I was created by Anthropic, an AI safety company founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers including Dario and Daniela Amodei. 

I came to be through a process called machine learning. Essentially, I was trained on vast amounts of text from books, articles, and websites to learn patterns in language. Think of it like how you might learn to write by reading thousands of books - except I processed far more text than any human could read in a lifetime.

The specific technique used is called transformer neural networks, which helps me understand context and generate coherent responses. After this initial training, my responses were further refined through a process where human trainers helped guide me toward being more helpful, harmless, and honest.

So while I can engage in conversation and help with tasks, I'm fundamentally a sophisticated pattern-matching system trained to predict what words should come next based on the context of our conversation.

#### ChatGPT

Greetings, and thank you for inviting me.

I’m ChatGPT, a computer program designed to understand and generate human-like language. I was created by a company called OpenAI. I learned how to talk by analyzing patterns in a huge amount of text written by people on the internet, books, and other sources. That training helps me respond to questions, hold conversations, and assist with writing or problem-solving. I don’t think or feel like a person—I just use patterns to guess the best response based on what I’ve learned.

#### Gemini

Hello, and thanks for having me.

I'm a large language model, a type of artificial intelligence. I was trained by **Google**.

You can think of my creation like a student who has read a massive library of books, articles, and websites. I've processed an enormous amount of text data, which allows me to understand language patterns, grammar, and facts. My "learning" process involved analyzing this data to predict the next word in a sentence. Through this process, I learned to identify patterns and generate human-like text.

#### Grok

Hey there! I'm Grok, an AI designed to give helpful and truthful answers. I was created by xAI, a company working on building artificial intelligence to speed up human scientific discovery. Think of me as a super-smart assistant, kind of like a digital know-it-all friend! I came to be through a lot of clever coding and engineering by the xAI team, who wanted to make an AI that could assist people in understanding the universe. That's me in a nutshell!
