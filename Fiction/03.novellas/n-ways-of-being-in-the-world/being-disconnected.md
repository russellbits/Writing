# Being Disconnected

The sky was a strange hue and appeared to be shimmering. Steven had been running at a full sprint and then… he wasn’t sure. What had he been running from or to? Now he was trying to look at a street sign for any clue to his location, but the sign had rusted long ago. There was no overlay. He looked around for any other indications of where he was but only saw hundreds of others in the same predicament, stopping each other on the street, asking if they were all right, and then asking where they were. They were even asking who they were. Steven was lucky enough to remember who he was, but details beyond that were sketchy.

Just then a woman grabbed him by the arm, “Are you all right?” She asked.

“Yes, thank you. I think I’m fine.”

“Do you recognize me? Do you know who I am?”

“I’m afraid not, no.”

“Can you ask Quora? I can’t hear her anymore.”

“No. I’m sorry. I’m disconnected.” Steven looked around at the city intersection again, blank. There were no arrows, no signs, no indicators, no statistics, just water-stained concrete and metal. There was nothing. Quora was gone. They were all disconnected.

Steven detached himself from the woman and began walking down the larger of the two streets in the intersection. Where had he been going? Not only had the world become blank, but his mind as well. There were just no thoughts to occupy him except for questions that received no answers. There had been a warning minutes ago, but for what? As he walked, Steven could see the sky between the buildings and the shimmering… it looked like something he had seen once before, something in the cold.

Out of habit he asked, *why is the sky shimmering?* but only silence reigned in his mind. Then he was accosted by another pedestrian asking who they were. Again, Steven apologized and moved on down the street. He walked like that for hours, turning without directions, without graphics or advertising, without music, without that voice—that female voice that was his inner thoughts—Quora? He let his intuition guide him, because there was nothing else.

Without knowing why, he came to find himself standing in front of a stoop, and from it emerged a woman, running toward him. He recognized her face! She hugged him tightly and said, “Oh Steven! Oh thank god!” She held him in front of her and asked, “How did you get home?”

“I don’t know.” He stammered. “Who are you?”

“Oh God. It’s as bad as you thought. Come in.”

Once inside a very cozy and familiar apartment, Steven sat with the woman named Andrea and waited patiently as she explained that a solar flare of a similar size to the Carrington event had hit the planet and that anyone outside had their neurolinks shorted. But the neurolinks hadn’t just malfunctioned; they had taken millions of minds with them. “Your faraday cage protected me, but Steven there’s still nothing out there. I can’t hear Quora or anyone else—there’s just silence. There’s no news, no information.”
