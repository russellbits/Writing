"It buried us alive in the winter of 2036.  Giant sheets of metal seemingly constructed themselves from out of nowhere and covered the Earth in a matter of days.  We watched helplessly from outside the planet with our satellites, but after a few days, all of their signals disappeared.

He hadn't been friends with many people.  He spent a great deal of his life alone.  Often, when he was in public, he was alone.  The school bus almost matches the color of the yellow in the autumn leaves.  Sometimes he is everyone's favorite person on the bus---other times he is the enemy[1], the symbol of the man, or rather, the Principle in this case.  The bus comes everyday to a bend in the road.  It is at this soft bend in the road that three children get off the bus.  These are the youngest children that he is told to watch over.  Normally they smile at him and thank him for stepping off the bus and guiding them to the safety of the side of the road.

"I always took care of people Ben.  I always took care of people."

"We all know you did, John."

"You can't not put me up there with them.  Jesus!  We are all being held accountable... on this..."

"We all know who is accountable.  I'm going to make sure you go.  Don't be an idiot.  Any astrophysics-chemistry-who-cares-what is going up there to see what's going on.  I do understand your patriotism."

"Ya' should've said so in the first place!" The boss walks down the hall.  "And you're an asshole for not sayin' so---"

"Asshole."

Physics for him was the nature of the way the world moved around him.  It had very little to do with how one object moved away from another.  it moved toward him or away from him.  When he was a kid the moon followed him.  In the back seat of the hatchback he would sit and look up through the slanted glass and there would be the moon, chasing him around.  They would sometimes travel for hours and hours.  One time they traveled across the entirety of the United States.  They were flooded out in Alabama.  They were blown over in Texas.  They were even out in the woods and lands long enough to see the forest side of Texas and the not-so-forest side of Texas.  They drove across Texas and Arizona and stopped to see the Grand Canyon.  They stayed in a camp site that was three blocks away from the gas station and it was there he caught a horny toad.  Damn strangest thing he ever saw---like some kind of alien.

The moon followed him.  it followed him from state to state and he began to wonder a bit about it.  he began to wonder if it was soft.  He wondered if it was flat.  he started to notice how the shadow changed as the Moon moved down the sky.  He saw it leaving.  He wondered when he might see it next again.  Now he is wondering if humanity will ever see it again.

A brusk almost pitbull voice fills the air -- resonates of the cheap ceiling tile.  "When the impact of the first cone occurs, you're going to have to do what you can to steer clear of it."

"I gotta' jerk it?"

The pitbull voiced manâ€™s sincere eyes drink the room in through his thick glasses and leans against a chalk board.  Some of the diagram he has drawn on the board is smeared by his shirt.  "Yeah, basically."

"And what are the odds that this jerkin around are get me somewhere near the shell?"

"Why do you think we're sendin' thirty-two of you?"

"Well, hell, I'll be the only one to make it."

The pitbull rolls his eyes.  "No one doubts that, John."

Something almost evaporates through his ears.  It is not that he can hear nothing---just that nothing has raced by and left behind complete silence.  His place has leapt through some kind of ether wall and left behind the world of sound.  Of course, through his helmet there are decibels of noise.  Each screech sounds like a halt, but he is living in the meter.  he is watching the number telling him that he is and will be for quite some time the fastest man in the world... well... the man who traveled the fastest.  In medieval days they believed that if you traveled faster than a galloping horse, you stood a good chance of just bursting into flames.  His cockpit frothed and like a dying animal of some kind, screaming, he rolled over Death Valley.

The government sought to communicate with as many people as possible with emergency broadcasts on every spectrum -- at least, between commercials.  Nonetheless, the greater fear of the government at the time was that simply leaving the world to darkness might cause mass riots and pillaging.  They were totally correct, although strangely enough the riots had to do nothing with geographic locations in the world.  They tended to follow a fairly random pattern.  Psychologists would have made something of this later, except there was to be no later.
