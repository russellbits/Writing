Title: Hotapromo “Ace of Wands” Submission
Date: 03/13/24
Prompt: Write a letter to HOCUS describing a project you've always wanted to take on, but haven't yet had the energy, time, or confidence to pursue. Describe the project in detail, including why it inspires you and what scares you about it. Guess what? This letter is a big step on the road towards completing that project!

Dear Hocus,

I have felt for a long time, that if our television, movies and video games are rated for consumers, then we should have a similar ratings system for the corporations that dominate our economy and culture. They’re potentially far more dangerous. I would call the project “Rated C for Corporate”. It would consist of easy to decode and understand infographics that display how the corporation performed for the benefit of consumers.

I believe that consumer-oriented projects such as the Better Business Bureau and Consumer Reports once served the public, but have become tools for industry rather than serving the us. “Rated C for Corporate” would consist of infographics that easily display how a corporation performs in the following metrics:

1. CEO to wage-earner ratio
2. Environmental impact
3. Collective public good
4. Diversity
5. Transparency and Accountability

I believe a key aspect of this project would be the graphic that illustrated these performance metrics. By being truly easy to read, I believe they inherently would have the ability to go viral. These infographics could be made available through a web browser plug-in that would affix these graphics to web pages based on URLs. Alternately, the graphics could be printed on stickers and given to volunteers to be applied to street print advertising in a guerrilla effort. I imagine that if the graphics were truly useful, consumers would find lots of ways to engage with them.

I would also create an accompanying web site where a consumer could look up any company and see the metrics and how they were determined. There could be a company-to-company comparison feature. It might be possible to create a Reddit-like feature that would allow people to contribute information to affect scores with some editor oversight.

There are several difficult hurdles to this project. One, figuring out metrics that are fair, consumer-oriented, work across multiple industries, and are hard to argue against. Two, it requires the gathering of a vast amount of information. It’s hard not to see this program as a Wikipedia-like effort with all sorts of people being able to contribute, fact check, and edit. That sort of development comes with its own problems if it is to become a trusted source. If the nature of the site were to allow crowdsourcing, then strict protocols would have to be put in place to verify the information provided, as well as ensure fairness and weed out folks with an axe to grind.

Believe it or not, the thing that most scares me about such a project is if it were to succeed! I look to individuals like Craig Newmark who created Craigslist and Jimmy Wales who founded Wikipedia and have let their creations largely take over their lives. Would I truly want to commit everything to this endeavor? I think I could handle this part, especially if it were to become more of a communal effort as it grew.

There is also potential for significant corporate blowback. Would corporations try to engage, pervert or outright sue an individual or organization for attempting such a project? This part keeps me up at night, knowing as I do that corporations rigorously defend their bottom lines and don’t play nice.

Still, I can see “Rated C for Corporate” planned out in my head. I can see the infographics. I’ve made several attempts to design it and work out the metrics. To see such a creation develop and spread out across the web and the real world would make me truly proud.

Thanks for getting me to sound this out, Hocus!
Yours sincerely,
Russell Warner
