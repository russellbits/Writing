# The First People

The hull of the ship was rough and untrustworthy. She had been built in record time, faster than any spaceship in human history, and she was aimed at the Vessel.

Commander Kate Wills checks out with ISC control, looking out the forward window of the ship Babel, and seeing the Vessel now appearing as a small speck of light. The ship must be huge. Her gaze drops and the control panels in all their methodical primary colors fills her sight, and she wonders for a moment if this mission was risky at all. Space this deep meant death, but meeting with an alien species meant what? Her death was nearly irrelevant when she thought of the death of the human species.

We, the human species, couldn't even speak with them. The mission was a guess. We didn't know at all if they wanted to talk to us. They had sent signals, but all the world's cryptologists had made no sense of the communique. Kate imagined she might be arriving at a surrender.Staring at the bright light in the middle distance, Kate remembered that her entire life was devoted to never kneeling before anyone. Whoever these people were, showing up in our part of the Galaxy, they would know that they were contending with something significant.

> For the first time, Babel has sent back photos to the International Space Conglomeration, of the Vessel. Though a dot in the path of our spaceship Babel, it is very real now. Satellites and many other technological marvels found the ship, but now, for the first time, we are very likely to come into contact with an extra-solar species—maybe an intelligent one! Dubbed "The Vessel" only months ago, humanity came together to create something that could meet these apparent travelers. It remains unknown if there are living beings on this Vessel or if the Vessel itself is some massive galaxy searching drone. A robot. Perhaps it has no interest in speaking with us at all?

## The Cafeteria 

"Is it a binary choice that it can or cannot communicate with us?"

"Seriously, Cornish? Are you breaking down meaning? Communicate or don't, there's no gray there."

Fletcher jumps in now, "I disagree completely, Captain."

"How!?"

"I don't know. There was grunting, there's all kinds of communication that aren't written or even literal."

"How the hell are we ever supposed to *talk* to them, then?"

For the first time that half-hour, Lilly spoke, "There are necessary agreements in language. We'll make those."

The Captain, having noticed Lilly now, "Necessary?"

"Up, down, most prepositions—then obvious adjectives. Maybe gravity?"

Captain Kate smiles, "I have the utmost respect for you Dr. Recinco, but you are giving me the impression that you're just coming up with this plan?"

Staring at the cool metal of the cafeteria table, Dr. Recinco replies, "When was I supposed to be preparing for this?"

## Science Meeting

"I thought the Captain had a point."

"And I understand it. It's just that... this is not about translation."

"No?"

"No. We are going to have to build vocabulary from the ground up. And it will have to be by consensus. If we don't agree on a single term, it will have to be ignored."

"Really? So you're really creating a new language?"

"I don't see any other way. Languages mix, they influence, they change. This might be a whole new way of looking at the universe. What word am I supposed to choose to tell them something like that?"

Howard says, "Lilly, I don't think—"

"Make a new language then. Discard what you know about the real human condition; rather, invent a utopia while you have the power."

"Mikhail!"

"What? We are Amerigo Vespucci; we write story now."

Lilly: "It's not like that at all. I will influence them, they will influence me, it'll change after that too—a lot. There's no control here."

Fletcher: "There is one element of control here. We can make nice or not. Let's make nice (as best we can)."

> With still takes minutes, communication out near the orbit of Mars, the ISC has confirmed that the Babel has docked with the Vessel. What comes next, no one knows.

## Full Team Conference

Captain Kate takes a long breath and stares at a mock-up model of the hoped for arrival on the alien vessel. "I will be point. Dr. Recinco, you will be on my right. Calhoun, you'll be on my left. Everyone else fall in side-by-side, science and military."

"I have to take a moment to say,..."

Deep breath.

"We don't know what happens next. Let's be present. This is the moment. Stay present. Hold off on even gestures. I mean, cough, fart, whatever, but just—we are likely going to meet a new intelligent species—let's be our best. And polite."

> Gordon: Are we to believe that they are speaking with us?
> Warner: There are some agreements about the meanings of basic information, but there is still a long way to go until we are truly understanding them.
> Gordon: Do they like us?
> Warner: That remains unknown.
