## In which Able reaches the figure digging beneath the gnarled tree.

The landing is not an easy one. Despite the pleasant drift of floating in the air, as the ground grows closer and closer, Able realizes that he is traveling faster than the view from high up had indicated. He pushes his feet out in front of him and braces for sliding into the rough ground. The tablets crumble beneath his feet as his little fling drags him along. He pulls it towards himself and lets his knees bend, rolling on to the ground kicking up  a large cloud of dust.  Standing, he brushed himself off, folds up the fling and puts it back in his pillowcase where he can hear the rolly chirp in admiration at its compatriot's newfound form. He scans the horizon for the gnarled tree and sets off in the direction.

After walking a few hundred yards he can see the figure moving at the bottom of the tree, kneeling on the ground and digging. Able stops to look back across the broken lands towards the mesa rising from the earth like a massive finger cut off at the end. The clay and dirt is bruised and blood colored. Atop the mesa he spies a bright green glow, blinking and waves back at what he assumes is his buzzing. He turns from the mesa toward the gnarled tree and the digging figure beneath it. His feet crunch and his extended sole wobbles as he tries to tread across all the discarded rhetoric of many ages long since gone.

Slowly, in time, he reaches the figure, a woman from the looks of it, with gnarled hair and a massive wicker basket on her back with all manner of tools poking out it.  She does not look up as he comes toward her.  Huddled in a tattered and dark red cape, she is grasping a sharpened bone and shoving it into the ground and dragging dirt away.  She has removed all the tablet shards from a small circle and is digging in the dirt underneath.  Able cannot fathom why but he smiles. "Hello," he says.

"Hmph."

"You're digging in the dirt."

And so she continues.

"Why?"

Without looking up, she says, "Did you know that Jupiter ate one of his children? Do you even know who Jupiter is?" 

"No." 

"He's the sky, you little idiot. Yes. Levy. Jupiter's son the shoemaker: Levy. He ate him whole." 

"I didn't know that Jupiter was the sky, but I knew that Jupiter's father wanted to eat his children," Able says helpfully.

She stops digging and looks at him surprised.  "You knew that, did you?"

"Yes."

"Levy.  Jupiter swallowed him whole because he could not bare the embarrassment of having such a plain child as a shoemaker when all his other creations were so glorious."

"Venus," Able said and nodded.

The old woman furrows her brow and concentrates.  "Yes.  Venus was one of his more beautiful creations.  But how do you feel about him eating Levy?"

"That seems sad."

"Does it?  You are a child of Jupiter.  You are!" Now she looks up at him, one eye closed, her face wrinkled and covered in dirt.  "For he fathered all things.  And he wants all things to be good.  So why shouldn't he devour a son who chooses to waste the gift of his being on something as lowly and mundane as shoemaking?"

"Mundane means simple," Able answers.

"That's your answer?"

"I think shoemaking could be lovely. Especially if you made the shoes out of neat things that you could find—colorful things."

The woman cackles.  "Colorful things! My aren't you something."  She slowly raises herself up off the ground, her knuckles cracking as she holds out her hand summoning him for support. He helps her rise. "Come with me, my color-addled friend.  I will show you something."

## In which the Color Crone shows Able creatures of color that he has never seen before.

The ancient withered hand, forever scratching at the gray sky lie far behind Able and the Color Crone now and they are approaching a pair of buildings amongst the refuse of tablets and soot. One of the buildings is covered in a large dun-colored tarp.  "I have had a garden for a very long time, my young friend," the old woman speaks as they walk along hand in hand.

"But only recently did a man come to me and offer me something in exchange for some of my fruits."  She looks at Able.  "Eggs."

Able smiles.

"Tiny eggs.  Hundreds of them."

Able lifts his eyebrows in surprise.

"Yes."  They come to the door to the greenhouse and she opens it.  "Inside quickly.  I don't want them getting out."

Once inside Able looks around at the many plants in pots and rows.  They are mostly all the color of boiled spinach or ash, but each and every one is adorned with brilliant green praying mantis.  Able's eyes grow wide and he quickly shuffles over to one nearby to look closely at the tiny monster.

It looks back at him and he starts.

The old woman laughs.  "Yes.  They will do that; clever little things."

The little creatures look so much like his mistakes in so many ways, but so much more solid and patient and... determined.  His mistakes, he knows, serve no real purpose, but these tiny little machines appear to serve some purpose.  Able goes from insect to insect looking at each one. They are deliciously uniform, while each retains some slight difference.  And their color is remarkable; truly bright and almost glowing.  Vibrant.  "They are beautiful," Able says and takes a moment to catch his breath.  "And their eyes are so large!"

The old woman smiles and pats Able on the shoulder.  "They are not just large my little friend, they are manifold.  Look closely at them." She shuffles about and digs through some pouches hanging from her belt, producing a large crystal disc. "Here, here," she hands it to him, "Look at their eyes through this." Then she busies herself with tending to the garden.

Able holds the crystal up to his eye and aims it at the head of a mantis, vastly enlarging it. Sure enough, what originally appeared as two individual eyes on each side of the mantis's head are actually massive collections of tiny eyes shaped into spheres. Able ponders this for a moment, wondering what it must be like to see so much more—perhaps even other colors? "Do you think they can see things we can't?" he asks the old crone.

"I'm certain of it." She leaves her chores and approaches him, "I'm as certain of it as I am that *you* see things that others do not." She stares at him awaiting a response, but Able has none. "You *make* things that others cannot make, don't you?"

## In which the Color Crone tells Able of the legendary Master of Mistakes, and Able learns of new uses for his skills.

The old Color Crone's home looked like a giant clay pot that had been overturned on the plain of dead ideas, with circles carved out of it for doors and windows. Inside, there were more plants sitting about on countertops and hanging from the ceiling. Able and the old woman were sitting at a small wooden table with bowls of stew, and Able's little mistakes (numbering five now) are spread out across the surface, rolling and humming and bumbling.

"Mistakes, eh?" says the old woman between slurping in spoonfuls of stew. She watches the machinations with something bordering curiosity and suspicion. On the one hand, the creations were unnatural, and yet their agency gave them more than the appearance of toys. She knew what it implied: that Able intuitively understood something of the code, of the laws that governed the Shattered Land, though he was clearly naive to such ideas.

"I guess. Mistakes, yes." Able pauses to watch the older rolly curiously investigate its newly transformed sibling, the fling. The fling itself had gobbled up its glider parts and with an unceremonious burp, grown into a large purple ring shape. It was currently laying flat on the table and swelling and shrinking with what appeared to be deep breaths. "I call them that because they aren't meant to be, and also, because I don't really know how I make them."

"Do you picture them before you make them or change them?"

Able thinks on this while pushing stew around his bowl. "Not really. It's more that I think about what I need them to do—which I guess, a lot of the time is nothing terribly important."

One of the mistakes is busying itself with trying to investigate the crone's bowl of stew, and brushing it away, she replies, "Clearly, *some* of them do not do anything terribly important." She stares after the little mistake which replies with an indignant huff of air. "But," and with this she looks at Able seriously, "you should learn more control. And there is someone whom I have heard of that I believe you should seek out—someone who knows a great deal about mistakes—someone, in fact, called the Master of Mistakes."

Able's eyes widen. "Really?"

"Yes. Now I have never met this master person, but the man who brought me the insect eggs—Gef is his name—he could take you to see this Master of Mistakes. The master and his acolytes live in a traveling ultracircus far to the East of the plains. Gef could help you find them, I suspect."

"How do I find Gef?"

"He'a a trader; one of the more far-traveling ones from what I gather. So you might find him among the traders that gather at one of the crossings to the Moon's Run."

"The Moon's Run? Is that far?"

"It's a two day journey from here, due East. I will give you some supplies to take with you, and I'm willing to bet that one of your little mistakes here might be willing to show you which way is East." Upon hearing it, the old rolly wobbles over to Able's bowl and bumps into it a few times. The crone smiles, "A volunteer?"

Able picks up the rolly and turns it over a few times, "You can show me which way is East?" East makes able think of yellow, because of a dream he'd had once where the sun was yellow. He stares at the mistake carefully and senses the color yellow somewhere within it. Pressing his thumbs into the crown of the rolly, he peels back slices of it, revealing the yellow light that whirls into a small circle with a pointy end that begins to turn one way and another and then with a gleeful ping turns hard and stands at attention. The rolly, now having taken on the appearance of a dissected orange, begins to spin and rises up out of Able's hands, hovering in midair, then zips off in the direction of its yellow light until it slams into the wall of the crone's home and falls to the ground. With a disappointed whirring noise, the rolly, now more of a spinning star, hovers up again and alights back on the table next to Able's bowl, its yellow light still pointing in the same direction.

"There you go," the old color crone says, "East." She smiles mischievously and gets up from the table to fetch a book from one of many scattered about her hovel. Flipping through several, she comes to a sketch and brings it over to Able. "That's what Gef looks like, if I'm any sort of artist."

Able marvels at the drawing, having never seen one before; he'd only seen long lines of inscrutable characters on old tablets. "That's wonderful! It's like seeing something when it's not there." Without thinking about it, Able reaches for a mistake shaped like a top, covered in small pieces of crystal. It never did much more than spin about on its pointy end while taking in light and projecting beams all about it as it spun, making spyrographs of light. With there being very little light in the old crone's home, the mistake had been sitting on the table doing nothing. Able pulls the candle in the center of the table over to himself and begins stretching the mistake shaped like a top into a kind of tube, all the while staring intently at the crone's drawing of the creature called Gef. Slowly, short beams of the candlelight become loose from its flame and drift in through the crystals on the mistake. Able continues to form the mistake, rotating and pushing the crystals into the center of the tube and shaping the ends into points. Then, holding the points between his index fingers, the little mistake begins to spin and as it does, the light inside its crystals branch out and create an image of Gef like the drawing, until finally it appears that Able is holding the translucent head of Gef in his hands.

The color crone marvels, "You are quite impressive, little Mr. Summary."

## In which Cal explains the Cyclopedia and the Green. The orange buzzing finds something in the Moon's run.

"You said you had a cyclopedia to trade?"

"Yeah! I managed to get my hands on a few *volumes*, actually. Eh. Don't tell nobody that, though. If anybody asks, you say I've got some 'entries,' k? They're worth quite a lot."

Able shrugs, "I don't even know what you're talking about."

"Really? Where'd you come from, before you found me at the Trader camp?"

"Uh. West."

"You got family?"

Able thinks, for the first time in a while, of his poor mother, laying in her little spot amongst the pumps and devices. Then he thinks of his mean father and terrible brother. "Yes."

"Oh. Don't want much to do with them, huh?"

Able think on his mother again. "No. I just... well, they don't like me is all." And it was true. Even though his mother loved him dearly, she always looked at him like some sort of puzzle, something misunderstood, a curiosity.

"Did your paw farm?"

"Yes he did. He farmed for Truth."

"I bet he did. All them damn laws and philosophies--look kid, le'me put it this way: there ain't but one truth and *that* is the cyclopedia. It's from the Outworlds, and it tell the truth about everything. Problem is it's mixed in with all that other garbage in the desert."

"Well, what's the truth?"

"That none of this is real, Able. Real... real is something far away from here."

Able didn't understand Cal at all. Surely *he* was real. The 'pede they were riding on was real. Able thought it was a very strange thing to say. But then, lying was strange and *unreal* and he'd seen that happen, so maybe he didn't know what was real after all.

* * *

The green buzzing smashed into the desert at the edge of the Moon's Run with an enormous boom and a cloud of dust. It floated up out of the desert sands and over to the edge of the canyon. It sensed Able nowhere any longer, but down in the canyon, it sensed something familiar, something kin. With beeps and coos of curiosity, it moved over the edge of the canyon and down the wall. There was rock and dust everywhere and nothing about the place was safe and the green buzzing turned orange.  After quite a long time, the orange buzzing came upon a pile of rocks that had something under them. It squeezed into the cracks in the rocks and dragged out the pillowcase. Setting the pillowcase out on the ground, the orange buzzing nudged it. At first, nothing moved, but then, after a moment, one of the rollys rolled out of the pillowcase with a loud moan. It couldn't roll very far, since the ground was nothing but piles of rubble at the base of the canyon, it turned up to the orange buzzing and made a farting noise. The noise sent the orange buzzing swirling in circles of irritation, but the rolly ignored it and went back into the pillowcase to fetch the fling. The fling was in bad shape, half crushed, it couldn't move on its own at all. It just huffed and sighed. The  rolly rolled on top of the fling and scooted down until the fling was pressed into a bowl shape, and the two mistakes' gaps and lenses glowed the same color yellow. With that, the rolly-fling shot out a webbing around the orange buzzing and chirped.  The orange buzzing's color shifted into a moody orange and it huffed and being lifting, the three mistake floating slowly up out of the canyon.

## In which Able and most of the traders escape the oncoming Moon.

Able clings desperately to the trader in front of him, one arm wrapped around his waste, the other clinging tightly to his little sack of mistakes. The trader's mount moves incredibly fast across the badlands, its hundreds of legs scrabbling through the rocks, pulling them up and over boulders, its thick chitin exterior slick and hard to hold on to as it vibrates.  Able can occasionally grab glimpses, through the billowing cloak of his new trader friend, of the other riders around them all yelling and urging their steads onward, the whole of the badlands dark and now, where they had been peaceful and quiet, suddenly ominous, the faces of the rocks becoming brighter and brighter as a massive round pale and white circle appears on the horizon.  Able clings and listens to the hundreds of clawed legs that scrape and scratch like the sound of a massive mistake beyond his imagination and then somewhere beneath those sounds, the rumble of a crushing low sound, barely audible, and much, much larger than anything Able had ever heard or imagined. Avalanches on the Mesa, he had heard, thousands of pounds of rocks coming down, but not like this sound; the horizon itself being crushed and folding in on itself.

All of the traders' steeds come into close formation now, racing somewhere whose goal Able cannot see. He could almost reach out and touch some of the other steeds as they rumble along side-by-side now. Able listens to the yelps of the riders, urging their steeds onward, faster and faster. Able looks up from the back of the trader he clutches to and catches a glimpse of the massive yellow orb coming at them, larger now more than it was mere moments ago, coming close enough that Able can see it's pockmarked yellow surface moving, rolling. It seems to him like the traders and this massive boulder are intended to collide.

One of the traders near Able hollers out to Able's rider, "It's too close! No way we're all gonna' make it across!"

Able's trader says nothing in reply, but calls over his shoulder to Able, "Don't worry, little buddy! We cross the bridge in order of profits. We'll make it!"

Able wants to ask what profits are, but he can barely catch his breath as he tries to keep his seat on the giant steed. He clings more tightly to his rider as he stares at the Moon. Inching slightly to one side, Able tries to look around the torso of his rider to see up ahead. Coming up quickly to the pede, racing with its hundred legs, each longer than Able, is a massive chasm. Able shifts again, from his rider's right side, to the left, and his eyes trace the dark edge of the chasm in front of them out to the horizon to the North, where the Moon is barreling down upon them. He can see now that the Moon is no longer on the horizon, but that a fraction of it is hidden only by the chasm. It is in the chasm, like a marble in a groove, rolling, and even bouncing. The Moon is huge, many times taller now, he can see, that even the great mesa cannot stand against this onslaught.

As the riders come to the chasm's edge, they are slowing and gathering close, like water in a bottleneck. Able shifts and looks ahead and he can see a long bridge crossing the chasm, a gossamer thing made of heavy thick rusted chains. The riders are jamming up as they order themselves to make the crossing, the first steed already scrambling across. Able can hear his trader mutter, "Ain't no way everyone's making this crossing." He tugs on his steed's reins and yells, "Get in there!"

With the riders having slowed their pace, Able can right himself on the back of the steed and shouts up to the trader, "Why cross now? Why not..." but he's not sure what else anyone would do but run away from the glowing monstrosity coming at them down the chasm, close enough now that Able can see massive clouds of stone and debris broiling out from underneath the Moon in its run.

"That bridge ain't gonna' *be* there in another twenty minutes. It'll be months before anybody can cross the Run again." The rider turns in his seat just enough to look at Able. "You trust ol' Cal, little buddy. I got a bunch of cyclopedia entries on the Outworld; worth more than enough to make sure we're at least the fifth across."

Hoots and hollers continue bandy back and forth between the riders as they push and shove and urge their steeds into line, but the shouts are now being drowned out by the low rumbling that is increasing in volume by the second. But just as Cal had assured him, before he knows it, their steed is stepping out onto the web of chain and making its way across the swinging structure. Able looks out to the side and he cannot even see where the steed's legs end or where they are touching the chains. He holds his breath though when he can see any land beneath drop away a thousand feet beneath them. He looks out and he can see now where the chasm sinks into the Earth and crawls off toward the edge of the world, and at that edge: the Moon, so massive that it appears to be the edge of the world itself. "Hyah!" yells his rider and the steed scrambles faster across the chains. Looking ahead, around his rider again, Able can see the chains, which seemed so massive, but now, stretched out before him, seem like string. There is another three hundred yards to go.

Able looks backwards for the first time and he can see, beyond the fifty or so writhing section of their steed, covered in leathers and bags, the other steeds behind them, stepping out onto the chains and clambering close behind them. But not all of them.  Some of the riders, in the back of the crowd gathered the entrance to the bridge, are turning their steeds around in large C shapes and moving away from the bridge. Able yells up to the rider, "Some of your friends are leaving!"

"Yup!" yells Cal. "They're not the ones I'm worried about!"

Looking forward again, Able can see that there are three more of the giant steeds ahead of them, the furtherest just now crossing off the bridge. Beyond that, there are two or three dark shapes of riders now riding onward past the bridge into the night.  The rumble of the moon has become a cloud inside Able's head and he can hear almost nothing but the sonic din of smashing. He takes a deep breath and look out down the canyon to the Moon and what he sees astounds. The Moon is a circle of yellow so huge that he has to tilt his head back as far as it will go to even see the peak, and the booming noise of the rolling escalates into a crash, like a hundred thousands hammers smashing, as the Moon lifts into the air and up out of the chasm, having bounced off of a twist in the run. Suddenly, after the crash, the rumbling vanishes and the Moon is in the air, still rolling, but silently, and the whole of the desert is frighteningly silent, the only sound to be heard is the thousand clinks of insect feet sticking to chain links.

Away from the canyon, the Moon rolls through the black night sky, and Able looks ahead and see the steed just in front of them crossing onto the land on the other side, all of the other riders are looking up, their faces yellow from the glow of the Moon, their white eyes wide and deathly afraid. From somewhere, Able hears a voice cry out, "Go! Go! Go!"

The Moon touches down again, half in the canyon, half out of the canyon, where it tilts and rolls sideways just a touch into the base of the canyon again. Surprisingly, at first, there is no noise. But after a few moments, a massive wind, filled with dust and debris buffets them and the chain bridge lurches sideways, carrying their steed and Able's rider and himself with it. Able grabs on to his rider with both hands, dropping his pillowcase, and the rider in turn bends over entirely, dropping the reins and clasping the seat with both hands. The steed, climbing along the bridge, now entirely sideways, never stops its clawing towards the other side.  For a long moment, Able can see and hear nothing, only feel his world turned upside down.

Then a noise arrives on the heels of the wind, an ear-splitting crash that brings with it miniature moons of boulders flying through the yellow air like scattered children's toys, smashing into the the sides of the canyon and tearing off pieces of it. The chain bridge rights itself and Able, rider and luggage and thrust back to their right as they both desperately cling to each other and the steed for dear life. Able opens one eye, but all he can see is dirt and rock, a swirling dust all glistening with brilliant yellow light. He cannot make out the moon itself, only a wall of light.

The steed makes it to the other side of the chasm and lurches onto solid land, rearing itself up into and S and leaping ten yards out of the chasm. Able feels himself float up into the air off the back of the steed, still clinging to his rider, still clinging to the giant bug. Just as quickly as he was in the air, he's smashed down into the back of the steed, and the creature is dashing at an amazing speed away from the chasm. His rider has sat up again and yells out into the dust and smoke, "Yah!" The deafening rumble is now behind them, but still loud enough that Able can barely hear his rider's victorious yawp.

On this side of the chasm, the traders and their steeds are scattering in all different directions, and as they ride away, Able looks back long enough to see an arc of yellow, filthy, cratered rock, with no apparent edges other than it's front, smash into the chains, three steeds still crossing it, pulling the whole assembly into a thousand pieces and dragging the riders beneath it in an avalanche. The sound of the Moon is so loud that Able can hear no screams or shouts; he can only see the tiny steeds quiver and buck like earthworms on a sidewalk, everything around the scene buried in detritus and the whole of the landscape covered in a rain of rock. He looks away from the Moon and buries his face in Cal's back.

## In which Able and Cal ride toward the scrub plains and the green buzzing goes in search of them.

With the wreckage of the moon behind them, Able has time to think and realize that he no longer has his pillowcase, which means he has lost his picture of Gef *and* his way East. He's not at all sure what to do and turns to Cal, "Can we go back?"

"Go back?" Cal laughs. "That wasn't excitin' enough for ya'?"

"It's just that... it's just that I lost my bag."

"Your little bag of hoozywhatzits? Damn."

"So?"

"So, anything that fell into the Moon's Run got smashed into a thousand tiny pieces, son. Even if we did go back--which ain't a good idea at all--there wouldn't be anything left. We need to head on if we're going to catch up with Gef and we need to get some supplies as well. This 'pede needs her food and going back to the canyon... well, I'm not sure we'd find anything for her to eat."

"Oh." Able hangs his head.

"Didn't you make them things? Can't ya' just make more?"

"Well, I suppose. But those... well, I liked those."

"They your friends, huh?"

"Sort of."

"Well, I'm sorry you lost 'em little buddy." Cal looks off into the distance of the desert. "That's kinda' life out here in the badlands, friend. You can't get too attached ta' nothin'. The desert has a way of findin' and takin' anything you come to love."

They right in silence for a while, the sound of the sound of the 'pede's one hundred feet shuffling through the rock and sand along fills the air. After a while, Able asks, "Where are we going now?"

"That way," says Cal, pointing in the direction they are heading. He turns in his seat just enough to see that Able doesn't find the joke funny. "Lighten up, little guy. About a day's ride from here is a big scrub forest. We'll head through that to a town on the North side. I can do some tradin' there, feed the 'pede, and we can see if we can find out about Gef's whereabouts."

Able, hanging on to Cal's vest with one hand, is leaned over and tracing the intricate paths on the shell of the 'pede with his other hand. "Ok then."

"Say there, what's your name?"

"Able."

"You jest got the one name?"

"Able Summary."

"Well, okay, Able Summary. Buck up. You're on an adventure, after all."

Able smiles. An *adventure*.

* * *

High atop the mesa overlooking Josiah Summary's pitiful shack, the green buzzing senses stretches itself out until it is the length of the spear and turns and points different directions trying to hone in on a pandemonium it senses in the distance.  It can sense Able here and there but not clearly and it shivers with concern. With a loud pop, the mistake converts itself back into a small studded sphere and drops down to the surface to roll around in circles; its way of pacing. Again, it pops into a spear and turns and points and senses. What it senses is very worrying. There is fear and noise and something very large, and Able is only there for brief moments at a time, appearing and disappearing in the static of output. Pop! And again the green buzzing turns into a sphere and rolls in circles. The mesa is high and good and safe and safe is of critical importance; it is what Able was thinking when the green buzzing was made. Safe is of utmost importance. But then, it did not manage to convince Able to stay on the mesa, which is high and good and safe. Instead, he jumped off! There was no safety in that.

Finally, the green buzzing decides: it would get Able and bring him back to the mesa, or someplace equally good and safe. That is what it should have done in the first place. It let Able leave and now there was noise and confusion. *Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.* As the green buzzing feels this sense of wrong it begins to glow with greater and greater intensity, lifting up off the surface of the mesa and floating in the air. It swirls around and around, glowing ever brighter, "thinking" *wrong and not safe, wrong and not safe*. It stretches itself out into a spear shape again and spins until it senses the source of the noise and wrongness, glowing still brighter until it is almost white and flashing, and then, with a tremendous *shhhhhhpang!* it slingshots itself off the mesa into the distance, traveling faster than anything in the Desert of Dead Ideas.
