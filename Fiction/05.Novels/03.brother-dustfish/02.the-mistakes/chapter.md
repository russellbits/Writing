You are listening to “The Arrival of Brother Dustfish” Episode #2 in a 25 episode limited series podcast.

# Introduction

In a shattered land, an unusually talented, exiled boy will seek out the Ultracircus. His search, and arrival at that place, will create the legend of Brother Dustfish. It is a legend, believed by few. It is part of a larger older legend, that there is one who will stop The Shattered Land from finally falling apart. The measure of destruction of the loss of time or logic in this particular place has been well realized. But no answer has risen or revealed itself.

To quote the Master of Mistakes:
> “Our astrologers have written it: the moon has fallen. And, this event is a sign of the end of times. The moon has fallen and who among us can lift it back to its home?

# Episode 2, Part 1

## In which we meet Able’s Mistakes (Po, Nip and Ka) and see what happens when a grundle does whatever it wants.

Able slips quietly into his room after foraging with his father for the morning. He slides a loop of twine around the door knob and a rusty nail in the wall—privacy of sorts. He sits in his small room in his father’s shack tucked beneath the giant, dead mesa in the Desert of Dead Ideas. Able smiles to himself as he reaches underneath his cot for a secret treasure. He smiles because he knows that not all the ideas in the desert are dead. He has three that are quite alive—he calls them his mistakes. They are, all three just small orbs of light and shifting clockwork-like parts. But they are more to him than the grundles he’s created to assist his mother at his father’s command. They have personalities.

When Able has spoken to his Father of machines and things he has made, his Father’s answer is always the same: “This is a valley of Men and Women who have been outspoken against the True nature of things; who have thought their words History! They have all been Wrong! Their petty and unnatural thoughts have come to Rest here because ideas cannot outlast the God of Time. All those outspoken against the True Nature of the universe are Dead and Wrong. They die with their makers after a time. And there is no idea ever conceived that does not rest here; in these fields.”

His mistakes roll about the floor, lighting up, whirring and blinking as they bump into the cot and Able and each other. He can hear the sound of his mother’s kind voice, asking him, *What are you dreaming Able?* Unlike his other creations, these three mistakes were created with no purpose—or rather he gave them no purpose. Instead he tried to imagine what purpose they might want for themselves. Po, the littlest of the three seems to want very little. Mostly, Po, follows Able wherever he goes. Able amuses himself by walking around the room in a circle and watching as Po goes everywhere he does, dodging the other two more rambunctious mistakes, singing a short sweet song of relief when Able sits down and Po can roll up against him and also sit quietly.

Ka and Nip are much more content to explore the room to its edges sometimes getting into pushing matches when their paths cross. In large part they seem to ignore Able and Po except when Able has gathered some of the electrum dust to feed them. When Able places his hand down with a small pile of the stuff, they quickly roll to him and suck it up with tinks and blips of satisfaction. Able feeds Po separately for this reason; the littlest of the three can’t compete with its siblings when a feeding happens.

After a feeding, all three of his mistakes light up much more, burning with orange and violet and green and pink light that seeps out from between their clockworks and panels. Able sits with his arms around his knees, Po by his side, cooing, while Ka and Nip duke it out hyperactively, until the afternoon respite is over. Able’s father will call out from the other room, “Boys!” and Able will herd his mistakes into a small burlap sack where they will fuss for a bit and then calm own, turn their lights down and “sleep” until later in the day when Able can check on them again.

Sitting and watching them after today’s feeding Able is delighted and takes in a sharp breath when Nip does something extraordinarily new. After bumping up against Ka several times, Nip sits still and quivers, its light fading, and then with a burst of light Nip is surrounded by two halos and lifts off the ground. Able’s eyes stretch wide as Nip easily hovers over its sibling Ka, circles around it once or twice teasing, and then flies back into Able’s hands, almost as if looking for approval. Curious, Able holds Nip aloft, even though he is not touching it. There is some kind of force between Able’s hands and Nip’s new rings. The rings around Nip glow and rotate and it’s as if there is an invisible glass sphere around the mistake now. Able almost shouts out with glee, before looking around in the quiet; instead, he holds Nip close to his face, a neon green light reflecting, and says, “Nice trick, Nip!”

## And now, an intermission…

# Episode 1, Part 2

## In which Able is teased and lectured, while Nip has other ideas.

Able dumps an armload of tablets onto the conveyor belt. He watches as the stone relics rumble down towards the grundle that crush them into chunks and powder, sad that he will never know what they meant, what they might say. Suddenly, painfully, he’s awakened from his brief reverie by his brother slamming a cart into his back. “Get moving, blackrock-for-brains.” Able steps aside to let his big brother lift the cart’s contents on to the conveyor belt. He sniffs and holds back some tears as he bends down to rub the backs of his ankles. His father, approaching with a cart of his own, shouts out to Able, “If you don’t keep moving in this world, son, it will cause you pain.”

Rubbing his nose, Able walks away from his father and brother off toward one of the mesa’s legs. He climbs a high pile of tablets to the top and looks south to see if he can see any of the dust clouds kicked up by the traders and their centipedes. Today he sees nothing. Later, after many more armfuls of tablets have been crushed and churned and broken, Able and his brother and father load a large cart with the blackrock. This cart is as tall as Jedediah and requires both Able’s brother and his father to pull down a long trail to an outpost where they pile the blackrock in the hopes that traders will come and leave some grain and livestock in trade. Able’s father and brother will be gone for several hours on this trip to the outpost and it is, by far, the best part of the day.

As Jedediah and Able’s brother are preparing to leave with the big cart, Able—without knowing why—says, “Father, I think I could make a grundle that would pull the cart for you, if you like.”

Jedediah turns to Able, silhouetted in the low gray sun. He removes his large-brimmed black hat and wipes his brow. “No.” Able isn’t sure what to make of the reply. He stands dutifully waiting to be dismissed looking up at his father, whose eyes are so wrinkled and frowning that Able can barely see his pupils. “We do that for your mother because she is *ill*. We men have our health and it is ungodly to use your—“ Able’s father searches for a word, “—your heretics when we have our health and can do this work ourselves.”

After a moment, Able’s father squats down to his height and says, with a little more patience, “God forsook this world because men were lazy. Whatever your creations are, Able, you must not use them idly. You should not use them at all, unless you must.” Able’s father puts his heavy, almost stony hand on Able’s shoulder. “You can still be a Godly man, my son, but to do so you must be humble about what you make.” Able looks to the ground and thinks about the mistakes in his room, hiding beneath his cot.

Back in his room, after his father and brother have left, and after he has checked on his mother, Able sits on the floor among his mistakes. For some weeks now, after a feeding, Nip would fly about the room. And now, for the last few days, it had taken to flying up next to a small window, high in the room. Nip would just sit at the window, lazily bumping against the glass, making a light tapping noise. Able, staring up at Nip says, “You can’t go, Nip. Besides, there’s no where *to* go.”

Nip flies several times from the window to Able, but when Able tries to hold the flying mistake, Nip whisks off back to the window. Finally, Nip does what it did the first time, hovering in place and quivering, it’s light growing brighter and brighter. The light is so bright that even little Po comes out from behind Able to look. (Ka is paying no attention whatsoever to his sibling’s seeming tantrum.) Then, with a flash, Nip has sparked a new third halo, and flies across the room opposite the window. In what seems like a rage, Nip glows bright green and then shoots across the room, smashing through the window.

Able’s face melts in horror. “No, no, no, Nip! Nip!” He jumps up and runs to the wall with the window. It’s too high for him to reach. He strains to see if he can make out the mistake anywhere in the sky. It’s bad enough if his father sees the broken window, but more than that, Able’s heart is broken that his little friend has left him.
