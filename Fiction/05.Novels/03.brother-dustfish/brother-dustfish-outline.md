# Brother Dustfish Chapter Outline

I'm starting to consider the idea that the book, like many other books of this ilk, should be divided into volumes or books. Book 1 in this case would be from the Idex Mortex to the escape from the City of Horn. What then would Book 2 (and 3?) be? I'm not sure, so it will remain just a thought.

## 1. We meet Able and find out about his life in the Desert of Idex Mortez.

### The Desert of Idex Mortez
The setting is a desert of tablets. There is a family with Able, our main character, his father, Jedidiah, his mother Evo, and his brother Kane. There are many dangers in the desert.

### Able the healer
We find Able healing a small mechanical creature in the desert.

### Evo
Able checks on his mother. She is very ill. He has built machines that help her to live, but his father is skeptical. Evo loved Able very much.

### The Mistakes
Able has three creations called Po, Nip and Ka. He calls them his mistakes. They are unusual entities that seem to have minds of their own and can do unusual things. Able's father has commanded him not to create or use such things.

### The Flight
Nip transforms into a flying entity and takes Able to the top of a dead mesa. From there Able sees many wonderful things and thinks about exploring the world.

### The Fight
Able and Nip and Kane get into a fight. Jedidiah breaks it up and banishes Able from the house and his lands


## 2. In which Able wanders the Shattered Land with Po, Ka and Nip

Able spends the night in the desert of Idex Mortex and tends to his mistakes. He wanders for three days and then receives a sign that leads him to a very strange house.

## 3. In which Able meets Ghendra who wants to send him on a quest.

After wandering through the desert, Able meets the Lady in Green. She has "plants" things that are so unlike the creatures her knows. They are smooth and don't seem to have seams and they "grow". Able never grows. And they eat and breathe—things that Able also does not do. Things that the rats of Idex Mortex don't do.

She gives him a mission—to find the Ultracircus, but he wants to go home to see his mother. He does so, only to discover that in his absence, she has died. He decides he doesn't want to 


## 4. In which Able finds Gef and the caravan.

Able flies to the caravan, finds Gef and Gef finds something interesting in Able and is willing to take him along. Unfortunately, the meteor Delphine, which rolls through the Delphine chasm, has arrived and now it is time to run!

## 5. In which Able frees a dustfish.

Able uses Ka to make a floating aquarium for a dustfish. This shocks and stuns Gef, who is mostly concerned with how to hide them from the nomans. Also, Gef reveals that one of the reasons he wants to find the Cycle is so that he can find out his name.

## 6. In which Able and Gef travel to the outpost of Kinton Station.

Gef finds some information about a Texo compass that could take them to the Ultracircus, but in order to get it, they have to go somewhere Gef doesn't want to; namely to see the mad scientist of the City of Horn: Baron Rollo Leocadia. Able makes some new friends but that turns out to be more trouble than it's worth.

## 7. In which Able and Gef descend into the Hollow of Tigers.

The are searching for a hollow that may have a secret door that leads into the City of Horn, a place that is otherwise very difficult to get into. While looking, they are set upon by an ambush of smoke tigers. Po manages to scare the creatures off with a massive hologram, but it drains him of nearly all his energy. And Nip gets severely hurt in the fighting. With the creatures gone though, the crew discovers the secret door.

## 8. In which the crew explores a temple.

The crew enter what appears to be a museum or an ark in which trees of all manner are preserved in massive terrariums. They are unsure what the point of such things are. They move from chamber to chamber until they find a canal that leads to a massive reservoir of water. From the reservoir, there is a staircase up and they make there way into the city.

## 9. In which the crew gets captured.

The crew wanders through the City of Horn, a city surrounded by walls and surrounding a literal, gigantic tusk or horn. A castle is carved into the horn. The city is filled with desperate people begging for food and water. It's filthy, squalid place. There are armored mechanical guards everywhere. Gef decides that the best plan of action is simply to do their best to get the attention of the Baron. And they do it.

## 10. In which Gef discovers many things and makes a bargain, while Able causes a lot of trouble.

The crew splits up to find a fast exit out of the city and to gain as much knowledge as they can from the library. The Baron appears in three places simultaneously to "assist" them. Gef and Po explore the library but can't get there hands on a lot of information because the Baron is there. The Baron makes a bargain with Gef that he wants Gef to destroy an enemy of his, the scientist Vivian, in return for the Texo Compass. 

Meanwhile, Able and Nip try to find a way to turn the water on in the city but the Baron interferes. With the help of Po, the crew makes a break for it, only to discover that Wacamolo and Rilla and Arthra are at the gates trying to get in.

## 11. In which the crew run in to some old friends

The crew travels toward the home of Vivian, who is said to live in Boisenval, the hanging city of the Lake of the Low, and shares what they have discovered from the Baron. Able and Rilla become friends. Wacamolo explains what the nanosphere is and shows the crew that he can manipulate it, but just barely. He explains to Able some principles of it. It takes a great deal of energy to do it. He shows Able a few cantrips. Po has lots of maps now!

## 12. In which the crew meet the Eyeless ones, the Durman.

The crew falls into a trap on the way to Boisenval. They are captured by creatures with no eyes. Able manages to befriend them when he reveals that they are going to see Lady Vivian the Scientist. They offer to volunteer to destroy her. They say she is bad for the land, once a member of the Council but now just a hoarder and enchantress. Able's not sure they're going to fight just yet.

## 13. In which the crew arrives at Boisenval and leads the Durman into the City.

With the Durman warriors behind them, the crew enters the hanging city and is met by the Lady Vivian, who destroys the warriors, turning them to stone, and takes the crew prisoner. She enchants Gef, and "turns" the mistakes, but can't enchant Able. She imprisons them all in copies of Ka and then leaves to destroy the Baron once and for all. They can see the storm from where they are trapped in her tower.

# 14. In which the crew is freed by the Lady Vivian

Lady Vivian returns, sadder than ever. In talking to Able Lady Vivian discovers that Able's mother is Evo and becomes enraged and sad that Evo is dead. But she realizes that this means that Evo had some sort of plan.

"The council was destroyed when one of our order decided to leave this world for the world above. The balance that we had created and that had lasted for a thousand generations was destroyed. This world has been crumbling ever since. Why would Evo make you. Why would Ghendra send you to find the Ultracircus?"



Able is to replace Gabriel on the council of the Masters of Mistakes. Gabriel left the world to find the real world. When he left, the council could not hold the world together. Able, like Gabriel, has the ability to introduce purpose into the code.

# Ideas for Later:

+ Gef's story

+ The villain of this story did what he did out of love; he didn't mean for the destruction to happen. But so long as its happened, he sees it as progress.

+ Po eats the Texo Compass

+ Evo was a member of the council.

+ Ghendra was Evo's student.

+ The crew meets a thing like Nip but massive and dangerous.

+ The crew has to make their way through a jungle of junk.

+ ~~Rilla and Wacamolo show up with Arthra and stuff at the entrance to the city of Horn.~~

+ Nip becomes a swarm. Arthra learns to fly (by walking on copies of Nip).

+ Baron Leocadia sends bounty hunters after the crew.

+ A con man joins the group

+ The crew acquires a fighter of some kind. Do they free a mechanoman?

+ Who are the members of the Council?
	+ Evo
	+ Vivian
	+ Gabriel
	+ Kiokesuimas
	+ ?

# Backstory

# Other Notes

1. Apply Dan Harmon's story circle or the other older mythology building tools to Able

What is the Story Circle?
1. A character you can identify with
2. The character has a wish or need that is unfulfilled
3. The need or wish causes them to cross a threshold
4. They go down a road of trials
5. They are searching for something and find it (like it or not)
6. That discovery kicks their ass
7. They come back to the world they started in having gone through trials
8. Having changed

Meanwhile, Hero of 1000 faces:
1. Call to Adventure
	Sometimes it is given by a mythical animal
2. 

1. Able has the ability to create the mistakes, but they are also his call to adventure. They urge him an push him to places. They are the mythical animal—also, they are the CODE.

Understanding, or at least manipulating the CODE is the unrealized boon!
