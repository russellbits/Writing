# Brother Dustfish Chapter Outline

I'm starting to consider the idea that the book, like many other books of this ilk, should be divided into volumes or books. Book 1 in this case would be from the Idex Mortex to the escape from the City of Horn. What then would Book 2 (and 3?) be? I'm not sure, so it will remain just a thought.

## 1. We meet Able and find out about his life in the Desert of Idex Mortez.

### The Desert of Idex Mortez
The setting is a desert of tablets. There is a family with Able, our main character, his father, Jedidiah, his mother Evo, and his brother Kane. There are many dangers in the desert.

### Able the healer
We find Able healing a small mechanical creature in the desert.

### Evo
Able checks on his mother. She is very ill. He has built machines that help her to live, but his father is skeptical. Evo loved Able very much.

### The Mistakes
Able has three creations called Po, Nip and Ka. He calls them his mistakes. They are unusual entities that seem to have minds of their own and can do unusual things. Able's father has commanded him not to create or use such things.

### The Flight
Nip transforms into a flying entity and takes Able to the top of a dead mesa. From there Able sees many wonderful things and thinks about exploring the world.

### The Fight
Able and Nip and Kane get into a fight. Jedidiah breaks it up and banishes Able from the house and his lands


## 2. In which Able wanders the Shattered Land with Po, Ka and Nip

Able spends the night in the desert of Idex Mortex and tends to his mistakes. He wanders for three days and then receives a sign that leads him to a very strange house.

## 3. In which Able meets Ghendra who wants to send him on a quest.

After wandering through the desert, Able meets the Lady in Green. She has "plants" things that are so unlike the creatures her knows. They are smooth and don't seem to have seams and they "grow". Able never grows. And they eat and breathe—things that Able also does not do. Things that the rats of Idex Mortex don't do.

She gives him a mission—to find the Ultracircus, but he wants to go home to see his mother. He does so, only to discover that in his absence, she has died. He decides he doesn't want to 


## 4. In which Able finds Gef and the caravan.

Able flies to the caravan, finds Gef and Gef finds something interesting in Able and is willing to take him along. Unfortunately, the meteor Delphine, which rolls through the Delphine chasm, has arrived and now it is time to run!

## 5. In which Able frees a dustfish.

Able uses Ka to make a floating aquarium for a dustfish. This shocks and stuns Gef, who is mostly concerned with how to hide them from the nomans. Also, Gef reveals that one of the reasons he wants to find the Cycle is so that he can find out his name.

## 6. In which Able and Gef travel to the outpost of Kinton Station.

Gef finds some information about a Vox compass that could take them to the Ultracircus, but in order to get it, they have to go somewhere Gef doesn't want to; namely to see the mad scientist of the City of Horn. Able makes some new friends but that turns out to be more trouble than it's worth.

## 7. In which Able and Gef descend into the Hollow of Tigers.

Able is to replace Gabriel on the council of the Masters of Mistakes. Gabriel left the world to find the real world. When he left, the council could not hold the world together. Able, like Gabriel, has the ability to introduce purpose into the code.

Ideas for Later:

+ Rilla and Wacamolo show up with Arthra and stuff at the entrance to the city of Horn.

+ Baron Leocadia sends bounty hunters after the crew.

+ The crew acquires a fighter of some kind.electrol
