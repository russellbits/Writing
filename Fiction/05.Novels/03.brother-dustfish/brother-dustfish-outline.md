# Brother Dustfish Chapter Outline

## 1. We meet Able and find out about his life in the Desert of Idex Mortez.

### The Desert of Idex Mortez
The setting is a desert of tablets. There is a family with Able, our main character, his father, Jedidiah, his mother Evo, and his brother Kane. There are many dangers in the desert.

### Able the healer
We find Able healing a small mechanical creature in the desert.

### Evo
Able checks on his mother. She is very ill. He has built machines that help her to live, but his father is skeptical. Evo loved Able very much.

### The Mistakes
Able has three creations called Po, Nip and Ka. He calls them his mistakes. They are unusual entities that seem to have minds of their own and can do unusual things. Able's father has commanded him not to create or use such things.

### The Flight
Nip transforms into a flying entity and takes Able to the top of a dead mesa. From there Able sees many wonderful things and thinks about exploring the world.

### The Fight
Able and Nip and Kane get into a fight. Jedidiah breaks it up and banishes Able from the house and his lands


## 2. In which Able wanders the Shattered Land with Po, Ka and Nip

Able spends the night in the desert of Idex Mortex and tends to his mistakes. He wanders for three days and then receives a sign that leads him to a very strange house.

## 3. In which Able meets Ghendra who wants to send him on a quest.

After wandering through the desert, Able meets the Lady in Green. She has "plants" things that are so unlike the creatures her knows. They are smooth and don't seem to have seams and they "grow". Able never grows. And they eat and breathe—things that Able also does not do. Things that the rats of Idex Mortex don't do.

She gives him a mission—to find the Ultracircus, but he wants to go home to see his mother. He does so, only to discover that in his absence, she has died. He decides he doesn't want to

Able uses Ka to make a floating aquarium for a dustfish. This shocks and stuns Gef, who is mostly concerned with how to hide them from the nomans. Also, Gef reveals that one of the reasons he wants to find the Cycle is so that he can find out his name.

## 6. Able and Gef make there way across some badlands on their way to the next outpost. Why does Gef take them off course from the other settlers? Able finds the Dustfish and makes a pet out of him. This throws Gef for quite a loop.
