# Chapter 1

## In which we meet Able and learn of his simple existence in the Shattered Land.

In the far reaches of the Shattered Land, in a Delta between where the Moon rolls along its canyon, and the Silt Sea shifts in undulations of dust, there is a place called the Desert of Idex Mortez. It's a barren gray landscape made up of piles of ancient stone tablets; piled as high as buildings in some places; piled precariously, leaning in the erosion. Upon those millions of stone artifacts are chiseled stories true and false, philosophies and theories, secrets and myths. They are all discarded, they are all very long forgotten, the languages they were written in, forgotten.

Very little lives in that desert. The piles of piles of ancient texts are dotted only by mesas that lord over the vast wasteland, and defiantly so. Those few creatures—fossilized, giant stone trilobites and silt centipedes—who choose to venture too far into the desert from the Silt Sea—transparent exoskeletons draped across the stone tablets and now their bodies only make homes for smaller things like silverfish and scurrying six-legged cybernetic chiton.

Why so much knowledge and history and law and philosophy had ever been discarded in the middle of a desert is unknown to any in the Shattered Land. Very few of the tablets, and very little of the writing can be read by anyone anymore. The language is lost. The tablets are a mix of cyphers, many from societies that no longer exist; their scribblings are just now representations of change. There is so much dust—and the shimmering, translucent heatwaves carry the well-kept knowledge further away into the distance, mostly eroding it to nothing.

The mesas move only at night, and in the Shattered Land there are only just a few stars; it is very dark at night in the Desert of Idex Mortez. Occasionally some errant trader might ride a silt centipede through the area, looking for some schwag or treasure (it is said there are still _books_ in the desert). Those travelers often make the mistake of making camp near a mesa. And when a mesa stands, ripping its long-settled bulk from its crater, stretching out its spindly legs, it’s sudden locution can be heard for miles around, like an explosion. It is a mystery why the mesas of the Desert of Idex Mortez move at all, but they do, walking for a few hours in the dark of night, often lit up by static lightning, only to crash down their entire bulk on some new spot for reasons known only to themselves.

It is difficult to tell a dead mesa from a living one, but not impossible. To begin with, a dead mesa's legs will close up around it in a tight, spiny fist; like a dried out spider. Another is the ultrasonic noise that live mesa's put out. You cannot hear it, but you can feel it in the ground. There are other ways, other signs, but the first sign is the best guarantee.

Nestled beneath one such dead mesa, there is a rusty shack where a man named Jedediah and his family live. Able's mother, Evo, is sick and lying in a bed in the shack surrounded by pumps and machinations that are keeping her alive. The older brother is a nasty brute; one who decided to turn his discomfort and pain on others. The youngest son is Able.

Every day, Jedediah and his two sons travel out into the desert where they gather the ancient tablets, stacking them on carts and hauling the refuse back to a clearing between the great dead mesa and their homestead. There, they load the tablets onto the brundlex, which scans the tablets and then pushes them along a conveyor belt where the tablets of philosophies are crushed. Out of the back of the brundlex comes *blackrock* — a mild fuel that can be sold to the trader caravans and others. With the right technology, blackrock can be used to create some light and small amounts of energy. The desert rodents, with their built-in brundlexes thrive on the stuff. Well, they animate.  A second substance comes from the process as well; considered to be waste. It is a silver dust known (not by the locals) as electrum; it is exhaust from the brundlex, exhaust from the wildlife. Jedediah cares nothing for the electrum, but he allows Able to have it because the boy has a strange knack for making things with it. It is, without question, a heretical behavior to make the things that Able does… One does  make J'onn in the face of J'onn nor movement in the face of J'onn but Jedediah looks past it. The things… the things-that-move-of-their-own… the things keeping Evo alive. And Jedediah is suspicious of his youngest son.

* * *

She lay buried among the hissing bio-brundlexes, in a tattered and gray linen nightgown. Able is not entirely sure she is even there since he can barely see her from where he stands in the doorway, but he can hear the brundlexes breathing for her. The little accordion towers surround her and move asynchronously up and down with tiny huffs and sucking sounds; liquids gush and rush from one tower to another, to some sphere that spins the liquid and dispenses it again. Though he brought them into existence, he does not know how they function. It is the way of the electrum that he gives it freedom, will and a goal.

The small back room is a miniature city skyline, almost entirely filled with tubes and pipes and dirty glass huddled in around the valley of instruments where her body lay on the small, rotting mattress. Only a single window, high up on the rickety bedroom wall allows in any light, and only a tea-colored light pushes through the twin filters of dirt and fingerprints on the inside and gray restless dust outside.

Able shifts his weight in the doorway and hears the tired floorboards beneath him creak, like a mourning that is disturbingly louder than his own. His is lost in confusion. He holds his hands uselessly at his side. Then clasps them behind his back. Then, he puts them at his side again — watching as the brundlexes rise and fall, his eyes moving from cylinder to cylinder as each one reaches a peak, seems to hold a breath, puffs and whooshes down again. The room is small chamber orchestra of gushing flushes, heaving movement, clicks and sighs.

Falling in a staccato shuddering, the paper lungs huff dust off into the air in snowy spirals where the tired light captures and frames each particle’s Brownian dance, the bludgeoning of a thousand tiny, invisible fists. Able feels each molecule of pollutant travel up his nose and down his dry throat into his crusted lungs. He closes his eyes and takes a moment to miss her. He travels backwards.

Lost in memories behind closed eyes now, he turns his head up from the floor, playing with bits of rock, to see her looking at him with that familiar and perplexed look on her face, wondering at the measure of her own oddity in him. He sits and plays with electrum creations that roll about on the floor, aimless but somehow excited. Then, as always she smiles and pats him on the head, the sun behind her silhouette, yellow and streaming.

Able opens his eyes to the reality of the room, filled with colors like mold, mildew, rot, and he is not sure why he remembers the sunlight ever being yellow.

Outside dust devils come to rattle the window and pay their respects with obsidian-eyed sorrow. The land is gray and covered with discarded speeches and arguments, stone artifacts chiseled with letters, the broken tablets of theorems and laws and philosophies, all overshadowed by a mesa, at the base of which sits Able’s father’s disheveled house. A few hundred yards away from their pathetic shack is a shallow grave that Able’s brother has dug. There, two rotted pieces of lumber, tied together with twine, lean miserably in amongst the detritus of long-forgotten ideas.

The mesa is singular. It dominates the landscape like a termite mound with giant three foot outstretched termite legs. For miles around it is the only structure aside from a decrepit and bony hand of a tree reaching up thirty-five feet from the ground to the north. East, further off from the tree, sometimes running against the dun-colored sunrises, marred by wavy lines of heat, run the silhouettes of the skin traders’ centipede caravans; slow, rumbling, and multi-legged.

* * *

Able slips quietly into his room after foraging with his father for the morning. He slides a loop of twine around the door knob and a rusty nail in the wall—privacy of sorts. He sits in his small room in his father’s shack tucked beneath the giant, dead mesa in the Desert of Idex Mortez. Able smiles to himself as he reaches underneath his cot for a secret treasure. He smiles because he knows that not all the ideas in the desert are dead. He has three that are quite alive—he calls them his mistakes. They are, all three just small orbs of light and shifting clockwork-like parts. But they are more to him than the brundlexes he’s created to assist his mother at his father’s command. These have personalities.

When Able has spoken to his Father of machines and things he has made, his Father’s answer is always the same: “This is a valley of Men and Women who have been outspoken against the True nature of things; who have thought their words History! They have all been Wrong! Their petty and unnatural thoughts have come to Rest here because ideas cannot outlast the Ungod of Time. All those outspoken against the True Nature of the universe are Dead and Wrong. They die with their makers after a time. And there is no idea ever conceived that does not rest here; in these fields.”

His mistakes roll about the floor, lighting up, whirring and blinking as they bump into the cot and Able and each other. He can hear the sound of his Evo’s kind voice, asking him, *What are you dreaming, Able?* Unlike his other creations, these three mistakes were created with no purpose—or rather he gave them no purpose. Instead he tried to imagine what purpose they might want for themselves. Po, the littlest of the three seems to want very little. Mostly, Po, follows Able wherever he goes. Able amuses himself by walking around the room in a circle and watching as Po goes everywhere he does, dodging the other two more rambunctious mistakes, singing a short sweet song of relief when Able sits down and Po can roll up against him and also sit quietly.

Ka and Nip are much more content to explore the room to its edges sometimes getting into pushing matches when their paths cross. In large part they seem to ignore Able and Po except when Able has gathered some of the electrum dust to feed them. When Able places his hand down with a small pile of the stuff, they quickly roll to him and suck it up with tinks and blips of satisfaction. Able feeds Po separately for this reason; the littlest of the three can’t compete with its siblings when a feeding happens.

After a feeding, all three of his mistakes light up much more, burning with orange and violet and green and pink light that seeps out from between their clockworks and panels. Able sits with his arms around his knees, Po by his side, cooing, while Ka and Nip duke it out hyperactively, until the afternoon respite is over. Able’s father will call out from the other room, “Boys!” and Able will herd his mistakes into a small burlap sack where they will fuss for a bit and then calm own, turn their lights down and “sleep” until later in the day when Able can check on them again.

Sitting and watching them after today’s feeding Able is delighted and takes in a sharp breath when Nip does something extraordinarily new. After bumping up against Ka several times, Nip sits still and quivers, its light fading, and then with a burst of light Nip is surrounded by two halos and lifts itself off the ground. Able’s eyes stretch wide as Nip easily hovers over its sibling Ka, circles around it once or twice teasing, and then flutters back into Able’s hands, almost as if looking for approval. Curious, Able holds Nip aloft, even though he is not touching it. There is some kind of force between Able’s hands and Nip’s new rings. The rings around Nip glow and rotate and it’s as if there is an invisible glass sphere around the mistake now. Able almost shouts out with glee, before looking around in the quiet; instead, he holds Nip close to his face, a neon green light reflecting, and says, “Nice trick, Nip!”

* * *

Able dumps an armload of tablets onto the conveyor belt. He watches as the stone relics rumble down towards the brundlex that crush them into chunks and powder, sad that he will never know what they meant, what they might say. Suddenly, painfully, he’s awakened from his brief reverie by his brother slamming a cart into his back. “Get moving, blackrock-for-brains.” Able steps aside to let his big brother lift the cart’s contents on to the conveyor belt. He sniffs and holds back some tears as he bends down to rub the backs of his ankles. His father, approaching with a cart of his own, shouts out to Able, “If you don’t keep moving in this world, son, it will cause you pain.”

Rubbing his nose, Able walks away from his father and brother off toward one of the mesa’s legs. He climbs a high pile of tablets to the top and looks south to see if he can see any of the dust clouds kicked up by the traders and their centipedes. Today he sees nothing. Later, after many more armfuls of tablets have been crushed and churned and broken, Able and his brother and father load a large cart with the blackrock. This cart is as tall as Jedediah and requires both Able’s brother and his father to pull down a long trail to an outpost where they pile the blackrock in the hopes that traders will come and leave some grain and livestock in trade. Able’s father and brother will be gone for several hours on this trip to the outpost and it is, by far, the best part of the day.

As Jedediah and Able’s brother are preparing to leave with the big cart, Able—without knowing why—says, “Father, I think I could make a brundlex that would pull the cart for you, if you like.”

Jedediah turns to Able, silhouetted in the low gray sun. He removes his large-brimmed black hat and wipes his brow. “No.” Able isn’t sure what to make of the reply. He stands dutifully waiting to be dismissed looking up at his father, whose eyes are so wrinkled and frowning that Able can barely see his pupils. “We do that for your mother because she is *ill*. We men have our health and it is godly to use your—“ Able’s father searches for a word, “—your heresy when we have our health and can do this work ourselves.”

After a moment, Able’s father squats down to his height and says, with a little more patience, “Ungod forsook this world because men were lazy. Whatever your creations are, Able, you must not use them idly. You should not use them at all, unless you must.” Able’s father puts his heavy, almost stony hand on Able’s shoulder. “You can still be a ungodly man, my son, but to do so you must be humble about what you make.” Able looks to the ground and thinks about the mistakes in his room, hiding beneath his cot.

Back in his room, after his father and brother have left, and after he has checked on his mother, Able sits on the floor among his mistakes. For some weeks now, after a feeding, Nip would fly about the room. And now, for the last few days, it had taken to flying up next to a small window, high in the room. Nip would just sit at the window, lazily bumping against the glass, making a light tapping noise. Able, staring up at Nip says, “You can’t go, Nip. Besides, there’s no where *to* go.”

Nip flies several times from the window to Able, but when Able tries to hold the flying mistake, Nip whisks off back to the window. Finally, Nip does what it did the first time, hovering in place and quivering, it’s light growing brighter and brighter. The light is so bright that even little Po comes out from behind Able to look. (Ka is paying no attention whatsoever to his sibling’s seeming tantrum.) Then, with a flash, Nip has sparked a new third halo, and flies across the room opposite the window. In what seems like a rage, Nip glows bright green and then shoots across the room, smashing through the window.

Able’s face melts in horror. “No, no, no, Nip! Nip!” He jumps up and runs to the wall with the window. It’s too high for him to reach. He strains to see if he can make out the mistake anywhere in the sky. It’s bad enough if his father sees the broken window, but more than that, Able’s heart is broken that his little friend has left him.

* * *

Able looks for Nip for days and can find it nowhere. In the mornings, when collecting tablets for his father, Able would circle all the way around the mesa, looking constantly for his little green buzzing mistake. Every night, when the sun set, even though it was dangerous, he snuck outside hoping that the low light would be enough to let him see an errant green glow. He did not stay out long, the desert was dangerous at night, he knew, but he also couldn’t help himself.

Then, one day, after his father and brother had hauled the big cart away, he open the tablet-crushing brundlex and emptied the electrum dust inside to feed Po and Ka. Without Nip there to take his share, both Po and Ka and grown in size. Po was still the smallest but Ka had grown very big—so much so he was about the size of Able’s head.

When he went to feed them, he was ecstatic to open his sack and see that there were once again three mistakes in the bag. Po was there and still the smallest, and Ka was there, and now Nip was there, too—at least he thought it was Nip. The little mistake was half the size of Ka, but no longer a sphere. It had grown a permanent ring around itself and there were small spires growing out of its “head.” beneath the spires Nip had what looked like an eye as well.

He knew it was Nip because no sooner were the three mistakes out of the bag then Nip and Ka were at it as usual, bumping each other. Nip rolled inside its new ring but it wasn’t long at all before its three halos appeared and it was off the ground hovering. Nip rushed by Able’s face a few times, even faster than he had been when he left. It hovered in front of Able and Able gently put out his hands to hold it. Nip allowed him to do so, but then after only a few minutes it began to tug on Able, tugging until Able stood up and then tugging again to move Able to the wall with the window.

Able found that he could grasp the new thick ring that Nip had grown, using it like a handle. Once he did this, Nip lifted him up off the ground, hauling him up to the window. Able scrambled to get his legs up on the sill and when he did, Nip made the strangest cheering kind of tweet. “Wow, Nip. Neat!” Nip made a second noise, what sounded like a warning, and then he carried Able off out the window and away into the air. Able gasped and tightened his grip as Nip whisked him far above the cabin, around an above the great spiny legs of the dead mesa and then with a loud triumphant chirp, hauled Able all the way up to the top of the mesa where it set Able down gently.

Able was ecstatic now, hardly containing himself as he stood on top of the mesa and looked all around at the yellow afternoon sky. He could see so far he didn’t even know what he was looking at. The piles and piles of tablets blended together into a beautiful landscape of valleys and paths. To the east he thought he could make out a kind of giant horn of some kind—a horn with more horns—but it was so far away it was a hazy shadow in the hazy air. There was something more strange and closer than the canyon. A small plume of smoke rose up from what appeared to be a giant beetle with its head buried in the ground. It's legs slowly moved around in the air. Nearby the beetle were a group of small spheres made of hexagons, buried in the ground. And there were lights.

* * *

Able sat with Nip on top of the mesa for a long time, marveling at all the things to see. Especially to the north where Able could see something he could not even explain. Something that direction undulated like clouds, but brown, and distinctly separate from the sky.  “I wonder what that is, Nip,” he whispered. He walked in a circle around the top of the mesa and decided to lie down and peer at his own house, hundreds of feet below, but to his horror, the big cart was back. “Oh no! Nip, my father is back.” He reached out to grab Nip by its ring and pulled it close. “Please, Nip, take me back! You have to take me back.” Nip chirped inquisitively. “Please, Nip! Down! Back down!?”

In a panic, Able grabbed Nip with both hands and started to climb down. Nip shrieked and then opened up panels all over its insides, released a flash of light, releasing its halos and strained to brake them to a slow fall as they scrabbled to the ground. Able’s heart leapt out of his chest in a way that he had never felt before. He had been afraid of his father many times, but that fear was nauseating and creeping; this fear was sudden and took his breath away. Still, Nip did manage to land them both safely and then ripped himself out of Able’s grasp and flew to Able’s face releasing a stream of clicks, chirps and shrieks as if scolding Able. But Able couldn’t pay any attention.

Running around the side of the cabin, then inside and straight to his room, he found the door open wide and his brother crouch ed over Ka with a chunk of blackrock in his hand that he was beating Ka with. Ka moaned and had dents and cracks and didn’t seem to be able to roll away while Able’s brother bashed it again with the stone. Po hid under the bed moaning. “No!” Able roared. Without thinking about anything he grabbed the upraised arm of his brother and threw his entire weight on him, causing the both of them to roll over each other on the floor. The blackrock had come loose and Able grabbed it coming on top of his brother and brought the rock down on his brother’s forehead. “No!” he yelled, having lost all sense of thought, his vision having gone red, tears streaming down his eyes. He hit his brother several more times in the head.

Jedidiah came storming into the room on hearing the commotion and saw his one son assaulting the other, saw strange objects floating and glowing and saw the broken glass and shouting, “Ungods forsake us!” He grabbed Able by the scruff of his neck and hauled him up into the air off his now unconscious brother. “What heresy is this?” he shouted at Able as he pointed to the mistakes. Nip, hovering near Ka, touching him gently turned a bright red color and flew in a flash at Jedediah’s face, crackling with bolts of energy. Shocked, Jedediah dropped Able roughly to the ground to swat at Nip who shocked him every time the old man’s stony hands struck him.

Able scrambled to grab his bag and Po and Ka, slipping them both in it and ran for the door past his father still contending with the enraged Nip. As Able ran through the main room to the door, crying, Nip changed from red to orange and slowly hovered away from Jedediah, who stalked the mistake as it floated away, still  keeping his distance. “This is vile, Able! This is evil! I warned you about your curse and you ignored me!”

Able stood in the main door of the house to the outside as Nip backed towards him and as his father, looming taller than ever and fuming, yelled, “You are a curse on this house! Get out! Get out of this house, get out of my valley. Never return!”

# Chapter 2

## In which Able wanders the Shattered Land with Po, Ka and Nip

With no direction to follow other than his father’s outstretched index finger, vaguely indicating to him to leave the valley, Able headed toward the upside down beetle, with its mysterious half-buried hives, and much further off, unknown to him, the Silt Sea. At the bottom of the hill between his Father's cabin and the tablet-crushing brundlex, he quickly grabbed a sack and filled with as much electrum as he could find. He not even thought for a moment about what he would eat, traveling out into the valley, but he wanted to be sure to feed Nip, Po and Ka for a time.

Able scrambled over piles of tablets with the sack of electrum and Po and Ka stowed in their bag, and Nip flitting about his head, just ahead of him. He inched his way through small paths that had been cleared over many years by his family and others who mined the tablets. After several hours of this, and as it was growing dark, he came to a depression, a crater in the tablets. Instinctively, he knew this to be the former resting place of one of the mesa's. It's size alone indicated a massive former presence.

It was then that Able realized the full scope of his problems. He was alone, at night, when the Mesas traveled (crushing other animals underfoot). He did not know where he was going. He had nothing to eat. He turned to the only thing he had: the sack of electrum. So, he might as well feed his mistakes. He scrabbled to the bottom of the crater and sat on the ground with his back resting against a stack of tablets, looking out across more open ground than he'd ever seen. Even all around his father's house, there were paths, small clearings and small canyons. But this was a circle of ground many more times larger that the footprint of his Father's house.

And then Able realized that of all his difficulties ahead, he wasn't sure if he should ever see his mother again. Of all his troubles, this one seemed very far from a solution. 

He released Po and Ka from their burlap sack. As usual, Po quickly retreated to Able's backside and seemed to hide behind him. Poor Ka, though, was in bad shape. It had gashes in it's side that seemed to be leaking a vermillion dust. Nip was high above the crater, about in its center, hovering. When Able looked up, Nip was the brightest thing in the night sky. There were few stars to be seen, not that Able knew what they were. Maybe they were siblings of Nip?

He attended to Ka first, taking a handful of electrum from his sack and pouring it on and around Ka, who seemed to swell up a tad and then sigh, and then shutter. As it did, Ka retracted in size a bit, but also the gashes disappeared from its surface. Ka brightened a bit in color also. "Feeling better, then?" Able asked, and Ka spun in a circle and chirped. "At least one of us is doing all right." He reached out and pet Ka, who reacted in no particular way, just rolling in angled circles, appearing to enjoy his renewed smooth surface.

Able turned with a handful of electrum that he held out to Po, behind him, and hiding underneath a tablet outcropping. It took Po a minute, but he gradually rolled out and partook of the meal. It did not seem to matter how much Po ate; he never got any larger, like Ka, and he never transformed in any way like Nip. In many ways, all three had started out the same, swirling dustballs. Po had gained more solidity, but other than that, had not changed in size at all. "My father said I was a runt. Are you a runt?" Po seemed to growl.

Finally Able turned a handful of dust to the sky, looking up at Nip, shining in a green-to-yellow and back again pattern. Nip made no noise, no move closer. Ka was bright enough that it never really got dark at the bottom of the crater, and Able was able to curl up at the bottom of the ridge and sleep, hoping that Mesas did not come to rest at the same place twice... often.

* * *

Able was rapidly approaching the upside down beetle. The wind rushed by him, into his nose, and his eyes because they were wide-open with wonder. They were drying out and he wanted to close them, but he couldn't bear not looking at the world as it raced beneath him.

That morning he had awoken with Po and Ka close by his side and Nip, back down from his vigil, scrounging around in the electrum bag. Able tried to drag him out of the bag just to make sure that he wouldn't eat all of it, but Nip was too heavy. Instead, Able pulled the bag off of Nip, revealing an almost swollen mistake. Where the center of Nip had been a sphere, it now pulsed, flat hexagonal surfaces, mashed up against one another, then shifting again into points—horns almost.

Able shooed Po and Ka (who were cautiously rolling in a perimeter around Nip) back into their bag. He picked up his other bag as well, and then began to make his way to the opposite side of the crater. But when it became obvious that Nip was not following, Able turned and walked back to him. "Are you sick? Did you eat too much?"

Able tried to push Nip with his shoe, but the mistake wouldn't move. "I'm not leaving without you. You need to come along." After a moment, "You don't *look* sick." He reached out to grab Nip's outer ring, hoping to be able to drag the little mistake, and much to his surprise, it was slightly warm and quite moveable. He grasped the outer ring and lifted it up, and with a loud *brrraaaat*, the center ring and then the core of Nip rose up from the ground as if pulled by puppet strings until they were in line with the outer ring. Nip's core spun wildly, vacillating from smooth to point while making a *phbbbbbbbt* sound.

"Sorry," Able said, and shrugged. "I didn't think I could move you."

Nip's core spun even more wildly, shimmering like a rainbow through one color after another. It grew brighter, too, with an increasing humming. the ring begin to pull back on Able's hand and lifted his arm up over his shoulder. Able hung on, but wasn't sure he should. "We tried this before, Nip! I don't think it's a good idea."

The core spun until it was bright white, the humming turning into a melodic chord, then a flash, and then two metallic ribbons burst out from the core and dropped down to wrap around Able's waist and behind his legs. The tones that Nip was emitting grew louder and higher, as Nip began to lift Able off the ground. As Nip beamed and sounded out, Able found himself sitting comfortably in the swing seat of ribbons. Then, Nips music ceased, and light burst out of him, returning him to a bright green shimmering. His core took the form of a dodecahedron, and the sound returned to a low hum. Before Able knew it, they were above the crater and racing off toward the upside-down beetle.

* * *

As opposed to when they practically fell off the dead mesa the night before, this landing was quite nice. Nip brought Able gently to the ground about ten feet away from the beetle with its head stuck in the ground. Only now, it didn't look so much like a beetle. For one, it was very tall. It's legs looked more like thumbs, and they didn't squirm about the way a desperate beetle's legs might. They pushed gently through the air, alternating back and forth,  each one with a fan embedded in each end. Nip retracted its ribbons and hovered in place. Able reached up and patted him, "Thanks, Nip. That might've taken us days to walk."

They had landed on top of a hill, and from where they were, Able could see new things. For one, he could see the dead mesa near his father's house, smaller now than he had ever seen it. Knowing he could travel faster with the help of Nip, he felt less upset about being away from home and his mother. Maybe his father would calm down. He could go back later.

Looking, down the hill, away from his home, he saw the structures that looked like hives buried in the ground. They were covered in hexagonal windows, almost the whole of them being dark glass. And then, not too far from those, he could see a figure digging in the ground. *Well*, Able thought, *I guess I could ask where I am*.

# Chapter 3

## In which Able meets someone new.

As he approached he saw that the digging figure was an old woman in a red cloak. Able wasn't sure how to start an interaction. He generally only spoke when spoken to. With his feet crunching on the rock, she must have heard him coming, but she did not look up. He stood still for several more moments, and then, "Hello. Could you tell me where I am?"

Without looking up, she said, "Did you know that Jupaeter ate one of his children?"

Able was struck silent by the unexpected question.

"Do you even know who Jupaeter is?"

"Yes. Jupaeter ate Levy, his son, the shoemaker. He ate him whole."

"You know that, do you?"

"My father told me." 

"Jupaeter's the sky. And he wouldn't take kindly to you dashing about on whatever that contraption of yours is."

"I... I couldn't really help it," Able said with a shrug.

She stopped digging and looked at him surprised.  "You couldn't help it?"

"Not really."

Finally, the old woman looked up, directly at Nip. "I suppose it has a mind of its own, hmm?"

Able just shrugged again.

The old woman furrowed her brow and slowly pulled herself up from the ground, bringing her digging instrument up as a cane. She is so hunched over that she is almost at eye level with Able.  "So how do you feel about Jupaeter eating Levy?"

"Seems sad."

She raises her makeshift cane and pokes it in Nip's direction—Nip flits back away—"And how did you come by such a thing?"

"I made it."

Bringing her cane down, and stroking her chin with her other hand, she closes one eye and looks Able up and down. "I find that unlikely."

Able was shocked, but replied, "It's very true." He pulled out his sack with the other mistakes, and poured them on the ground. "That one," pointing to Nip, "is Nip. These other two are Po and Ka."

"Ha ha! They have names, do they?"

"It seemed... appropriate? To name them?"

"Maybe. Have you eaten?"

"Not recently."

"Then, I suggest we go inside and eat and talk, little one."

"My name is Able."

"Oh, it has a name too!? Well, my name is Ghendra." She turned to walk away, paused, and turned back, "That is not my only name, but it's the only one you need to know."

The inside of Ghendra's home was crowded tight, filled with a hodge-podge of knick-knacks and thingamabobs, all piled and stacked and pushed into corners in no particular order or pattern. She cleared out an area and a cleared off a chair and offered it to Able to sit. Able picked up Po and set him in his lap as Ka rolled around the base of the chair, bumping into things. Nip had stayed outside. Once seated, there was silence for a time until Able began asking questions, and he found that once he'd begun, he had no end of them in mind.

He asked about the beetle. It was some kind of "moisture collector" and had something to do with gathering water and some other things that Able didn't quite understand. He asked about the hives and was told that they were greenhouses—houses for plants. He remarked that they were not green, and she replied that they were on the inside, as he would see later. First, they should eat, and she lay a wooden bowl of stew with mushrooms before him. Po, had been bouncing on Able's lap, seemingly wanting up onto the table, so Able lifted him up and let him roam about there, then began eating the stew. It was delicious. Able could hardly speak as he ate, not having realized how hungry he was.

"Now it is time for you to answer some of my questions, little one. How did you come to acquire these little friends of yours?" Able explained that he had not acquired them but had made them from leftover material from his father's brundlex. He wasn't supposed to make them. He told Ghendra what had happened with his father and how it had brought him here. Mostly, she listened, but at one point she mumbled, "Witless old fool." Able was not sure of whom she was speaking. She came to sit at the table, too, and as she asked more questions, Po made his way around the table near here, veering away when she first reached out to touch it. Able pet Po and said, "It's fine Po; she's a friend." And after that, Po allowed Ghendra to poke him and roll him over to examine him.

"I imagine, then, that you have built other mechanicals like this one, but they were different, no? More like my beetle—as you called it, yes?"

"Yes."

"But these three that travel with you, what was different?"

Able squirmed in his seat, unsure of the answer. "I didn't—or I don't—tell them what to do."

"Yes." Ghendra said with a sigh, "Such a boring life has a mechanical that has an intent—a purpose. I suppose it is good to have a purpose—not everything does—but then a purpose does cause one to repeat actions over and over. Can you imagine being such a machine?"

Able thought on this for a while. He did not know of any purpose that he had or had been given. His father spoke of their purpose at times, but Able never felt it in his bones. "I guess not."

Seeing that Able was done with his stew, Ghendra arose from the table and said, "Let's check in on the garden."

* * *

Once inside the greenhouse, Able felt the strangest sensation—that his skin was covered in some substance. It made the air feel heavy and cooled the back of his throat when he breathed. All around him now, he could see all manner of pipes that seemed to shoot up from the ground, split in any number of directions and end in bright green plates. He was baffled. He'd never seen so much color, let alone felt such a sense of life. Ghendra explained that the thing he felt on his skin was moisture—very thin water—and that the many things he saw were called plants, and that though they did not move or talk, they were indeed alive, and in fact, she pointed out, they tended to make more of themselves. They needed water and light, and beyond that, they would "do their own thing." In fact, she pointed out, the moisture that he felt on his skin, was in fact their breath. Able marveled at their beauty.

As Ghendra and Able shuffled down winding paths between all the plants, Ghendra spoke, "It is said, that a long time ago, back when the world was well-balanced, these plants grew *everywhere*. They did not need houses to thrive. They didn't need mechanicals to find water for them, for water was everywhere, said to even fall from the sky. That was when the council was whole. That was when the codification of the world was clear. But, as you know, from digging up tablets with your father, the codification has been broken for some time."

Able followed Ghendra as she walked, but didn't really follow her speech. *Water falling from the sky?*

Even more amazing, some of the plants had small bowls of bright colors, seemingly folded together out of paper. Ghendra called these flowers.

"Look at how much color you've created! It's fantastic!"

"I didn't really create it. I built the houses and gathered the water and planted the seeds. The rest was up to Jupaeter's wife, Gaea."

"I did not know that Jupaeter had a wife."

"No doubt. Many believe she left this world long ago. But that's not entirely true. She is merely sleeping."

The pair stayed in the garden for a time, Ghendra tending to the plants, and Able examining them all, breathless at the sight of yellow and blue and pink.

* * *

After a time, Ghendra and Able returned to the house. Able sat at the table again and this time Ghendra joined him, picking up Po to examine it. It chittered with nervousness as she held him. "This one makes me curious." She spoke to Po, "Your brothers seem content to absorb things and change, but you—you've been remembering things haven't you?" Po shook in Ghedra's thin fingers, seemingly spinning on the inside, until she set him down. Once on the table, Po rolled in a circle and then, three small feet unfolded from him, setting on the table to hold it still. Then, a split formed in its center, and a section opened up revealing a gem that was filled with light. The light stretched up from Po forming many dots that danced and coalesced into a picture of Ghendra's own face. "Oh my." A three dimensional blue and green light picture of Ghendra rotated above Po.

Able was stunned. "He's never done that before."

"I see." Ghendra got up from the table and made her way over to a stack of papers and books.

Able reached out across the table and grabbed Po and dragged it over in front of him. Po chirped and suddenly the light picture danced and changed into a picture of Able. Able laughed and said, "Po, how come you never did this before?" Once more the light changed and danced, turning deep purple, and creating the visage and Able's father's face. "Oh," said Able, sadly.

Ghendra set a heavy tome down on the table and let it fall open. She grabbed Po once again and turned it upside down. Po made a churlish sound and the light spread out of the book. But after a moment the light fell flat on the book and the letters and characters began to also glow. Po made many, many noises, all in succession. And then, after a moment, light from the characters in the book faded, and Po uttered a low bell sound. Ghendra laughed and turned the page, whereupon the whole process happened again.

"What is he doing?"

Ghendra smiled and looked at Able, again turning the page, "He's eating." She picked Po up after the third page turn and turned him feet-down on the table. "Now, show us."

Po's light danced about and in as many colors as the rainbow, he quickly illuminated a series of shapes and objects—a castle, a mesa, some tools, a wave, creatures—all so fast that Able could barely make out what they were.

"My, my," whispered Ghendra.

"I don't understand," said Able, his brow furrowed. "How is he eating pictures when there are none in your—" Able looked at the book on the table.

"Book," Ghendra said. "It is a book and it contains information."

"What is that?"

"Information is many things, Able. The world is filled with it, really. Your name, for instance, is information."

"My name?"

"Yes. Just a moment." Ghendra got up again and knocked a stack of papers and books to the ground. She picked up little Po and set him on the messy pile. "Have at it, little one." And Po's feet grew longer as he held himself over the jumbles of characters and began tracing them with light, and quickly.

Turning back to Able, Ghendra said, "If I wanted to talk about someone in the world, how would I do it if no one had names? I can't speak to you about my plants because even though they have names, you don't know them. But a name gives things a kind of uniqueness. Names are information. They are to the only kind of information—there are many kinds of information. Po, it would seem, eats information. You and I also eat information, but we do it differently. And when we want to remember or trade information, we have to talk about it. Po, he can simply show us what he's thinking."

Able nodded. "I see," he said, although he didn't really.

Ghendra made a quizzical face and then asked Able, "What do you feed you little mistakes?"

Able reached into his sack and pulled out the smaller bag of electrum dust. "It comes from my Father's brundlexes. He calls it electrum dust."

Picking up the bag, Gendra removed a handful of the shimmering dust and let it pour from her hand back into the bag, her eyes dancing over it, almost greedily. She blinked a few times, as if removing a charm from her mind. "Most people in this world of ours are fools, Able." She handed the bag back to him. "They would think this substance useless, as your father did. But it is special—very special. And you, since you know what to do with it, are also very special."

Able looked at the bag, noticing how light it had become. "Yes. I was thinking that, maybe after my father—maybe he wouldn't be mad anymore—and I could go home to get more."

"No. Your father is also a fool. You should seek out others like yourself. There are those that can do what you do, and they can show you more." She reached over and picked Po up and said it on the table again, where's legs shrunk down, and where the light again formed a picture, this time of a brundlex. "Bah," said Ghendra, "a primitive mechanical at best." She leaned in close to Po and said, "Show me the Ultracircus."

Po quivered and whirred and the picture of the brundlex transformed into an eight-legged machine with a plate on top of it, and on top of the plate, castle walls surrounding tall buildings. Though the image stayed in one place, the machine seemed to walk through the air. Ghendra spoke again, "You must find this place, Able. You must seek out your kind."

"I don't know. Is it far?"

"Who knows? I do not. However, I know someone who can start you in the right direction—a friend, of sorts. But I think he would be interested in helping you. His name is Gef. You will find him near the Moon's run. And there is this," she turned to Po again, "show me where the Ultracircus is, my little friend."

With that request, Po's light formed in to an arrow that pointed away from the mesa's and Able's home. It wavered, like the needle of a compass. "You see, little Po here can help you find the way."

"I don't know. I should go home. I need to help my mother."

"Your mother, Evo; I do not think there is anything you can do for her, Able."

Able wondered how Ghendra knew his mother's name, but not for long. "I don't know."

Ghendra made a bed out of blankets for Able. He lay down and watched as, across the room, Po continued to shine lights on books and papers and sometimes make squeals and beeps. Ka rolled over next to Able and nuzzled him. Able asked him, "What do you do?" to which Ka replied by purring. Able smiled and drifted off to sleep.

In the morning, Able gathered a now quiet and spherical Po and Ka and his sack. He crept about the house and saw Ghendra sleeping in another room. He made his way out of the house and looked up to see Nip hovering far above in the dusky morning light. He waved Nip down, and said to him. "Take me home, please, Nip."

* * *

When they arrived at his father's house, Able, from he sky could see his brother outside digging in the ground. He had dug a large, long hole. Nip set Able down away from the house, near a large outcropping of tablets where Able could see the house. As his brother continued digging, Able's father came out of the house with something in his arms—something wrapped in sheets. In his hear, Able knew what was in his father's arms—who was in his father's arms.

Abe watched as his father lowered the body into the hole. The two men stood quietly over it, Able's father having removed his hat, speaking, though Able could not hear him. Then, after a time, the two men began filling in the hole. Able began quietly crying as Po and Ka made soft noises in the sack. Nip hovered close by.

* * *

"You're going to need another name, little one," Ghendra said.

Able had returned to Ghendra's house in the afternoon and she could see from his face what he had discovered. She set poorly for him and hugged him. But she also knew that it would only be days before the caravan would leave at the next approach of the Moon, and then ti would be many months before the traders built a new bridge and returned to Idex Mortez.

"My name is Able."

"No, no. A surname. With it, you can add more information to yourself. You will be called Summary. When anyone asks, you can tell them you are Able Summary."

"Um, ok."

"You'll find the caravan to the east of here. You'll know them when you see them. There, among them, you will find Gef. Tell him that I sent you. And perhaps, don't show him or the rest your mistakes—not right away. Gef has been searching for some time for an object called the Cyclopedia. Tell him you can help him find it in exchange for taking you out of Idex Mortez."

"But I don't even know what that is."

"It won't matter; not right away. Just know that he will help you, and then you will be on your way."

# Chapter 4

## In which Able finds Gef and the Caravan.

As they flew through the air again, Able comfortable in Nip's seat, he could think of little else but his mother's eyes. He missed her desperately. In his lap, sat his sack with both Ka and Po and now a great deal of sweetbread and something from the plants that Ghendra called fruit and vegetables. He was glad to have it, glad to have met Ghedra, but he was also sad and scared. Never in his life had he known so little about what would come next.

In a way, he supposed, he had never known what would come next. Days only seemed to repeat themselves without much change. But now, having lost his mother, having seen his mistakes do amazing things right before his eyes, having met Ghendra and seen new colors... now, it seemed like his life was changing daily. There was wonder in it that he liked. But then there was no knowing what would come next.

In the distance, he spotted a mass crack across the land. Before it, the tablets of Idex Mortez spilled over each other, but the piles of ancient written language grew shorter and shorter in height until there was just barren ground. Past that, there was the crack—a huge wound in the ground that was wide and dark and seemed to stretch from one end of the horizon to the other. Then, between the diminishing piles of the tablets and the crack, he saw a mass of movement. He could see beige tents, and people moving about them, and massive creatures of a kind he had never seen or heard of before. They were long and made of sections and had many, many legs.

Able, looked up. "Nip, don't get too close. Let's just land nearby." Nip chirped a gleeful reply and flew lower to the ground, whisking them over the hills and hills of tablets until they came near the edge, where Nip set them down.

"Now, Ghendra said to keep you all hidden, so I need you to hide, okay, Nip."

Nip buzzed with some annoyance, but then sucked up the ribbons into it's ring of light, and then sucked the light into it's center. Nip turned a dull, metallic orange and dropped out of the sky onto the ground with a thud. It made a sound like a huff. "Well, all right," said Able. Nip was now just a dodecahedron and Able rolled him into the sack with Po and Ka who chirped different greetings. Nip made a farting sound.

Able hefted the whole, now *very* heavy sack onto his back and set off in the direction of the caravan. It amazed Able how quickly he had become used to the idea of flight. One day he had no idea that such a thing was even possible. Then another day he was breathless and amazed that it was. And now, he hated walking and carrying heavy stuff.

When he arrived at the caravan, people were pulling down the tents and tending to the massive creatures in their midsts. The creatures had looked so small from the air, but now Able could see that they were many times his own height, and bigger and longer than even his father's house. Most people simply paid no attention to him, even as he asked them about a man named Gef. Finally, though, one man, looking him up and down, shrugged and pointed at another man who was tying bags to one of the creatures. "Thank you," said Able to no reply.

When he got over to the man named Gef, Able forgot himself and said instead, "What is that?"

The man paused and turned toward Able with some curiosity. "What is what?"

"Um... your animal."

"What, kid, you never seen a centipede before?"

Able silently shook his head. The man scratched his head underneath his wide-brimmed hat. "Well," he said, "It's a centipede." Able nodded.

"You're a pretty far ways off from anywhere, kid."

"Oh. Well, I'm looking for a man named Gef."

"Ok. Well, that'd be me." Gef was world-worn, like Able's father, though his face seemed kinder. He stared down at Able from beneath his hat. "And you are?"

"Ghendra sent me."

"Ghendra, huh?" The man turned and tightened some straps on the bags on the centipede. "Okay."

"She said that you were looking for a—um—a cyclo..."

"The Cyclopedia?"

"Yes. She said I could help you find it."

"She said that, huh? Now did she mean that you *want* to help me or that you *could* help me?"

Able thought. "Um... she said I *could* help you. And she said that in exchange you could help me past the Moon's run."

"Really? So you know something about the Cyclo?"

"No."

Gef chuckled. "Wonder what that old crone is up to?"

Able thought on it. "She's growing plants."

Gef laughed louder. "Yeah, we all know that. Won't trade seeds for nothin', so what of it? What do you got in that sack?"

"Fruitsandvegetables."

"Fruits and vegetables."

"Yes."

"No, kid. They're two different things. There's fruit, and then there's vegetables."

Able stared blankly.

"Well, you're the only one around here who's got any of that, so that's something."

"Okay," Able said.

"You got a name?"

"Able Summary."

Gef furrowed his brow. "That's a weird name, kid."

"Is it?"

"Yeah."

The pair just stared at one another for a moment.

"Well, if you don't know nothin' about the Cyclo, I don't know how she thinks you could help. But then who knows what she had in mind—probably something. She knows things."

"She showed me lots of books."

"Is that right?" Gef paused.

Able panicked, and did something he did not like, he lied. He thought of Ka, and said, "I've memorized all of them."

Gef looked at his mount for a moment and then turned to Able again. "Well, you don't weigh much, so I suppose it's not too much trouble. Get yourself up on my pede and find a place to secure that sack of yours. We're getting out of here pretty quick. The moon's coming."

* * *

The bridge across the chasm was long, thin, and badly built. Mostly it was constructed of steel wires shot across the crack with massive crossbows. Everything on top of that had been knitted (with steel). The trader's camp had entirely disappeared; now there was just a traffic jam of centipedes waiting to cross the rickety steel-sewn bridge one at a time. The riders shouted at one another about their place in line. At times there were families onboard of massive insects and yet the order of the crossing was only respected in that it should be one at a time.

With not that many pedes in front of them, Gef called back to Able (barely hanging on to the chitin of the monster) that "We'll get to the other side soon! You can do whatever searching you want on the other side!"

And then, the order broke apart. Someone riding something other than a pede—a kind of steam effusing  mini-mesa—came racing down the edge of the chasm, screaming, "Moon's coming!" The world seemed to lurch as every driver of every pede now rushed the bridge and began crossing without concern, the entirety of the bridge beginning to rock with the thousand legs of tens of different centipedes.

The light was the thing that Able noticed. The whole time he had been with Gef and waited in line for the bridge, it had seemed like light was just present. At his own home, at Ghendra's home, there were clouds, and from them light. Now, a light had overtaken the horizon. The light was like a new horizon, different from the rocks and obscured things that Able knew. This light was moving; he could see the shadows changing. He saw something in Gef change, too. Where he had been unconcerned and ambivalent about crossing the chasm, now he was wide-eyed and scared.

Gef muscled his ride onto the bridge; ahead of many other riders. Able knew little else than to hang on; so he did. Gef managed his steed on to the bridge and the vibrations of too many animals crossing caused it to sway and warp and bend, but it didn't seem to matter. Able wondered, why bother? But Gef seemed absolutely sure, shouting loudly at others on the bridge, "Moon's coming'!"

Able wanted to grab on to Nip, or Ka, or Po, but the words of Ghendra kept in his head. Do not show them too soon. He grasped the mount of Gef and held on. Gef, in the meantime, maybe a quarter across the bridge, began to laugh. "If you wanted to ride with me, son, this is a fun chance!"

Beyond the bridge, down the chasm, a pale white orb began to reveal itself. Shouts across the caravan went up, "Moon!" And the orb, cratered and white, came over the horizon and into the chasm. The moon, rolled in its derelict and finished orbit across the world and towards the bridge that Gef and Able were only halfway across.

It rolled slowly and crushed everything in its path. For Able it was only revealed by one quarter as it came over the horizon and ruined the planet. But what was strange to Able was the light. Holding tight to Gef's mount, Able watched as shadows changed. The horizon was lit by this fantastic, giant rock that lit the already dark chasm. And Able was worried as Gef shouted at the top of his lungs, "Move, move, move!" There was death in it, and Able had not known it.

Three quarters of the way across the bridge, Able could see the moon coming over the horizon and rolling deep in the world he had once seen. It rolled like a bowling ball toward the bridge which was barely a thread in its massive domination. Able felt the need to shout, "Is that the moon!?"

To which Gef answered, "Just hold on!"

Able watched to his side as the massive rolling rock cracked down and bounced, destroying the canyon as it went. He thought about grabbing all the mistakes, especially Nip, to get him away, but he waited. He watched Gef, concentrated, sure. And Gef yelled, the whole time, "Go!"

Go they did. And on the other side, they watched as many on the bridge were utterly crushed by the rolling moon. The bridge was destroyed. The people on the bridge were wrapped into the moon. It took them away. The chasm was made different. And the moon passed on, driving, rolling down its (wash).
