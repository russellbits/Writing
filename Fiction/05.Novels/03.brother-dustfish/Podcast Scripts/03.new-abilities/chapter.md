You are listening to “The Arrival of Brother Dustfish” Episode #3 in a 25 episode limited series podcast.

# Introduction

In a shattered land, an unusually talented, exiled boy will seek out the Ultracircus. His search, and arrival at that place, will create the legend of Brother Dustfish. It is a legend, believed by few. It is part of a larger older legend, that there is one who will stop The Shattered Land from finally falling apart. The measure of destruction of the loss of time or logic in this particular place has been well realized. But no answer has risen or revealed itself.

To quote the Master of Mistakes:
> “Our astrologers have written it: the moon has fallen. And, this event is a sign of the end of times. The moon has fallen and who among us can lift it back to its home?

## In which Nip returns with new abilities

Able looked for Nip for days and could find him nowhere. In the mornings, when collecting tablets for his father, Able would circle all the way around the mesa, looking constantly for his little green buzzing mistake. Every night, when the sun set, even though it was dangerous, he snuck outside hoping that the low light would be enough to let him see an errant green glow. He did not stay out long, the desert was dangerous at night, he knew, but he also couldn’t help himself.

Then, one day, after his father and brother had hauled the big cart away, he open the tablet-crushing grundle and emptied the electrum dust inside to feed Po and Ka. Without Nip there to take his share, both Po and Ka and grown in size. Po was still the smallest but Ka had grown very big—so much so he was about the size of Able’s head.

When he went to feed them, he was ecstatic to open his sack and see that there were once again three mistakes in the bag. Po was there and still the smallest, and Ka was there, and now Nip was there, too—at least he thought it was Nip. The little mistake was half the size of Ka, but no longer a sphere. It had grown a permanent ring around itself and there were small spires growing out of its “head.” beneath the spires Nip had what looked like an eye as well.

He knew it was Nip because no sooner were the three mistakes out of the bag then Nip and Ka were at it as usual, bumping each other. Nip rolled inside its new ring but it wasn’t long at all before its three halos appeared and it was off the ground hovering. Nip rushed by Able’s face a few times, even faster than he had been when he left. It hovered in front of Able and Able gently put out his hands to hold it. Nip allowed him to do so, but then after only a few minutes it began to tug on Able, tugging until Able stood up and then tugging again to move Able to the wall with the window.

Able found that he could grasp the new metallic ring that Nip had grown, using it like handles. Once he did this, Nip lifted him up off the ground, hauling him up to the window. Able scrambled to get his legs up on the sill and when he did, Nip made the strangest cheering kind of tweet. “Wow, Nip. Neat!” Nip made a second noise, what sounded like a warning, and then he carried Able off out the window and away into the air. Able gasped and tightened his grip as Nip whisked him far above the cabin, around an above the great spiny legs of the dead mesa and then with a loud triumphant chirp, hauled Able all the way up to the top of the mesa where it set Able down gently.

Able was ecstatic now, hardly containing himself as he stood on top of the mesa and looked all around at the afternoon sky. he could see so far he didn’t even know what he was looking at. The piles and piles of tablets blended together into a beautiful landscape of valleys and paths. To the east he thought he could make out a massive canyon of some kind. But there was something more strange closer than the canyon. A small plume of smoke rose up from a group of small half-spheres in the ground. And there were lights.

## In which Able’s secret is discovered and consequences occur.

Able sat with Nip on top of the mesa for a long time, marveling at all the things to see. Especially to the north where Able could see something he could not even explain. Something that way undulated like clouds, but brown, and distinctly separate from the sky. He had no idea what it could be. “I wonder what that is, Nip,” he whispered. He walked in a circle around the top of the mesa and decided to lie down and peer at his own house, hundreds of feet below, but to his horror, the big cart was back. “Oh no! Nip, my father is back.” He reached out to grab Nip by its ring and pulled it close. “Please, Nip, take me back! You have to take me back.” Nip chirped inquisitively. “Please, Nip! Down! Back down!?”

In a panic, Able grabbed Nip with both hands and leapt. Nip shrieked and then opened up panels all over its insides, released a flash of light, releasing its halos and strained to draw them to a slow fall as they approached the ground. Able’s heart leapt out of his chest in a way that he had never felt before. He had been afraid of his father many times, but that fear was nauseating and creeping; this fear was sudden and took his breath away. Still, Nip did manage to land them both safely and then ripped himself out of Able’s grasp and flew to Able’s face releasing a stream of clicks, chirps and shrieks as if scolding Able. But Able couldn’t pay any attention.

Running around the side of the cabin, then inside and straight to his room, he found the door open wide and his brother crouch over Ka with a chunk of backpack in his hand that he was beating Ka with. Ka moaned and had dents and cracks and didn’t seem to be able to roll away while Able’s brother bashed it again with the stone. Po hid under the bed moaning. “No!” Able roared. Without thinking about he grabbed the upraised arm of his brother and threw his entire weight on him, causing the both of them to roll over each other on the floor. The blackrock had come loose and Able grabbed it coming on top of his brother and brought the rock down on his brother’s forehead. “No!” he yelled, having lost all sense of thought, his vision having gone red, tears streaming down his eyes. He hit his brother several more times in the head.

Jedidiah came storming into the room on hearing the commotion and saw his one son assaulting the other, saw strange objects floating and glowing and saw the broken glass and shouting, “Gods forsake us!” He grabbed Able by the scruff of his neck and hauled him up into the air off his now unconscious brother. “What heresy is this?” he shouted at Able as he pointed to the mistakes. Nip, hovering near Ka, touching him gently turned a bright red color and flew in a flash at Jedediah’s face, crackling with bolts of energy. Shocked, Jedediah dropped Able roughly to the ground to swat at Nip who shocked him every time the old man’s stony hands struck him.

Able scrambled to grab his bag and Po and Ka, slipping them both in it and ran for the door past his father still contending with the enraged Nip. As Able ran through the main room to the door, crying, Nip changed from red to orange and slowly hovered away from Jedediah, who stalked the mistake as it floated away, still  keeping his distance. “This is vile, Able! This is evil! I warned you about your curse and you ignored me!”

Able stood in the main door of the house to the outside as Nip backed towards him and as his father, looming taller than ever and fuming, yelled, “You are a curse on this house! Get out! Get out of this house, get out of my valley. Never return!”
