# Chapter 7

## In which the crew makes their way into a hollow of tigers.

After Gef is sure they're no longer being followed, the crew finds a butte with lots of crags for them to get down into and make camp for the night. As they are setting up, Nip immediately flies to spot fifty meters over the camp site. Gef looks up at the gold and green glowing spot and shouts, "We really don't need a beacon telling people where we are!" Nip changes color to a very dark purple. "Well, that's... better." Gef looks to Able who is examining Po. "Can you not tell it to stay down here?"

Able looks to the twilight sky and says, "I can't tell *it* to do *anything*." Able was frustrated with Nip, yes, but that was the way the mistakes were made. They had their own wills. They took suggestions, not orders—especially Nip. With that, Able gave Po a hug. Po purred.

Having laid out some large rocks that emit a bright turquoise light, Gef sits on a makeshift stool and says, "Well that did not go as planned back in town, but I did manage to get us some information."

Able was excited at hearing the word information. He had not heard any information in a few days. He sat cross-legged on the ground with Po in his lap. Ka'Rolly flattened its fake body out and set down on the ground next to Able, who pulled the cloak back and pet Ka.

"I had an old friend at the station. He knows stuff. He thinks the only way we can get to the Ultracircus is to find a device that can locate it. Do you know what a texo compass is?"

"I know what a compass is."

"Ok. Well, same principle. A compass is 'attached' to North, right. A texo compass is attached to a thing. You could have a text compass for your house, say." Gef looks to the sky, "You could put a texo compass on that little pest."

"He was only protecting me. He does that."

"I know, I know. Really, it's your fault. You shouldn't have been playing with those kids. I told you to guard Arthra."

Able looked to the ground. "I could see her from where we were playing."

"That's not the point, kid. We need to stay low. We need to not draw attention to ourselves. *Especially* if we go where we might be going."

Able looked up again, "Where's that?"

Gef explained where the city was, what it was like, and the sort of riddle that Wacamolo had told him. "He said the door would be unlocked by mistake. I have to think he was talking about your... uh... your little guys."

Able looked at Po and smiled. "I guess we'll have to find out." Able stared into the middle distance for a while and then said, "What are tigers?"

Gef stroked his chin, "I have part of the cyclo compendium on animals. It says tigers were an ancient animal; organic, very dangerous. They have existed for thousands of years though, so I think we're fine. We'll find this hollow and this wind and voilá, I suppose."

"Gef, where do you keep the cyclopedia? Can I or Po read it?"

"I don't keep hard copies. I've committed it all to memory. One day, I'll write it all down again, but for now, it's safer in my head. There are people who would use it for bad things, Able."

"Can I try something?" Able asked.

"Sure."

"Here. You hold Po."

"Okay." Gef reached out and took the metallic purple ball in his hands.

"Find out what he know Po."

Suddenly, Gef sat up like a steel beam. The light in his eyes dimmed and Po began generating an electric field whose arcs danced around itself and Gef's hands. This went on for several minutes until Po slowly faded back to normal and the light came back into Gef's eyes. "What in Gaia's name just happened!?"

Able took Po from Gef and said, "Show me a tiger."

Po's lights sparkled and danced in the air and coalesced into a light model of a giant orange cat with black striped, menacingly prowling though the air.

"I'll be a clock." Gef stared in wonder at the image of the tiger. He knew all the information about them, but had never really seen one. "It copied my brain?"

Able held Po out. "He copies all kinds of stuff."

"How?"

Able shrugged.

Gef cocked his head and kept looking at the tiger. "Amazing."  Then after a quiet minute of contemplation, he said, "Show us the city of Horn."

Po obliged and a light model arose of a massive castle build around an enormous tusk of some kind. Windows and walkways had been carved into he horn and all around its base were the scree of buildings. The walls surrounding it looked high and massive.

Able said, "That's where we're going?"

Gef corrected him, "That's where we're *sneaking into*."

"Wow. It looks as big as a mesa."

"It's much bigger actually. And we need to try to get an audience with a man there. His name is Baron Rollo Leocadia and he's a mad scientist." Anticipating Able's next question, Gef said, "A scientist is a person who studies how the world works—like Ghendra. Unlike Ghendra, they're usually incredibly powerful and you don't mess with them. They're supposed to belong to this guild, a group that they have that has rules, but some of them don't and they're called mad."

"So they're not angry."

"I don't know. He's probably angry about something, but that's not why he's mad, yeah."

"He sounds important."

Gef pointed at the light model of the city. "He runs that whole place. He's real important."

"So why would he see us?"

"He wouldn't. He wouldn't see dust men and I bet he *really* wouldn't see a couple of clockworks."

"You said that name was bad."

"It is. But it's *our* word. We can say it. It's bad when other folks say it."

Able nodded.

"However, I do think the Baron would like to see your little creations. He might even know what they are."

"Really?" Able's eyes widened. He set Po on the ground, who shut off the light model and rolled over next to Ka, bumping it a couple of times. Ka made a cooing sound and the dustfish swam over to look at Po. Able thought about what Ghendra said about only showing his mistakes when the time was right. That had really not gone according to plan. But maybe this time it made sense. "So if we tell him about my mistakes, he might tell us about the text compass?"

"It's not that simple. We need leverage."

"What's—"

"It means we have something he really needs or needs to avoid—it just means we have better control of the situation than he does—which is a difficult proposition." Gef looked at the mistakes, especially Po—how much of him had that little thing copied? How did he get int he middle of this? Why had Ghendra sent Able to him? "But look. We have got to stay low. Horn has a lot of very interesting things in it and you're going to want to check it all out. You have to hold off on that, okay? There will be time for that later."

Able nodded. "I will not be curious!"

Gef laughed. "All right. Let's get some sleep. We'll come up with a plan sooner or later."
