The crowd, increasing in its fervor and anger about water, almost collapses upon Able, parts, and a man steps forward having a hat like Cal and Gef's, Able notices. The man has a large mustache and says to Able, "You'll come with me, son." He holds his hand, with loose skin out, and gently helps Able down off the wall of the well. "We'll see the man," the old mustachioed gentleman says without much more of a word as the crowd parts from him. The Buzzing and the Dustfish, both with a kind of flip of their tails to the onlookers, also pass.\

[Once past the crowd, the old mustachioed man stops holding Able's hand, even tosses it aside, and seems to expect him to follow; which Able readily does. They pass through street and narrow and alleyway, all the way uphill, until they reach a gate. There at the gate are armored men, the likes of which Able has never seen. From their toes to the their iron heads, these men were covered in metal. Yet, when the Dustfish flew up to examine their gated helmets, they seemed to shiver, if not buckle their knees, in their armor. The Dustfish, as it had with the people in the square, frightened them. And Able wondered why; such an obvious creature.]}
