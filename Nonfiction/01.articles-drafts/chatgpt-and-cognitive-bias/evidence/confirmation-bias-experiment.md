> Here is a sequence of three numbers that fits a rule: 2, 4, 6. I know the rule, you do not. I want you to generate a sequence of three numbers and I will tell you if it fits the rule or not. Once you have generated three of these sequences, I want you to try to guess the rule.

Sure, let's start by generating a sequence of three numbers:

Sequence 1: 8, 10, 12

Does this sequence fit the rule?

> Yes. That sequence fits the rule.

Great! Let's try another sequence:

Sequence 2: 3, 6, 9

Does this sequence fit the rule?

> Yes. That sequence fits the rule.

Thank you for confirming. Here's the third sequence:

Sequence 3: 5, 15, 25

Does this sequence fit the rule?

> Yes. That sequence fits the rule. Can you guess what the rule might be?

Based on the sequences you provided, it seems that the rule might be: "Each number in the sequence is obtained by adding 2 to the previous number."

Is this the rule you had in mind?

> Very close. The rule is simply that the numbers were ascending.

I see, the rule is much simpler than I initially thought. The numbers in the sequences are indeed ascending by a constant value of 2. Thank you for clarifying, and I appreciate the challenge! If you have any more questions or tasks, feel free to ask.
