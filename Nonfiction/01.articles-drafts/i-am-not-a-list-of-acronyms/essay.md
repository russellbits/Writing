# I Am Not a List of Acronyms

My resume of late has become a list of (not even acronyms—initialisms). Just a reminder before we get started: acronyms can be pronounced. PHP is not an acronym; it is an initialism. Scuba and radar are acronyms. Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus is a mouth-full. SCUBA. Radio Detection and Ranging is RADAR. Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation is LASER. LOL and BTW and IMHO—none of them are acronyms or remotely clever. They are initialisms, which is just a pathetic way to not be clear about your communication.

My mother used to tell me that the problem with the word 'fuck' wasn't that it was grotesque—the problem was that it was a sorry excuse for a synonym. Surely, if you were going to be a writer of any salt, you could do better than 'fuck'. And this is how I feel about modern software. Surely, you could do better than think that a framework is a language. Like it or not, the programming language of the World Wide Web (a term lost on us) is going to be Javascript. Bye bye Java Swing UI.

But that's just it. I've been writing Javascript since its inception, and it used to be pretty useless. We used to have to protect ourselves from browsers, search and sniff them out to figure what parts of the user interface they might serve. We called it DHTML—Dynamic HyperText Markup Language—an initialism, not an acronym. Nothing to pronounce here.

And now my resume is made of HTML5, CSS3, JSX, SVG, AIML, GraphQL, SwiftReact, Gatsby, Vue, Svelte, Jquery, PostCSS, Semantic UI, Laravel/Lumen, Node/NPM, Webpack, Docker, Git, JQ, Redux, Apollo, D3, Threejs, Snap.svg, PixiJS

And none of it remotely describes what I can do.

A different list:

Data visualization, diagramming, calculus, Bayesian statistics, regular expression construction, bezier curve mathematics, illustration, design systems, storyboarding, animation, usability and human machine interaction research, technical and scientific writing

These are skills, not acronyms.

Writing alone—the idea of creating a narrative—is insanely complicated and video game designers fail at it constantly.
