# I Am Not a List of Acronyms or Software Packages

A significant problem here is that what used to be a skill, for instance, illustration, now must be encapsulated as Adobe Creative Suite or Sketch or Figma—some software package. Even more infuriating is that hiring managers and the people writing the job requirements know only the software packages and not the skill. One of the top ten skills searched for (again, [according to Ziprecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/career/Recruiter/Resume-Keywords-and-Skills)) is "MS Office." What is this meant to indicate? That you can write?—or understand good data visualization?—or that you can write interesting scripts inside Excel? How do we, as professionals, get through to our potential clients and hiring organizations that we are more than the software that we use? 

I'll make this history of my own as brief as possible. I learned to created vector graphic illustrations with Aldus Freehand.[^1] Yes, *Aldus*. I'm old. Then it was Macromedia. I'll skip over five years of Flash. Then it was Adobe Illustrator. Now it is [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/apps/) for me, and even sometimes plain text in SVG or the [SnapSVG](http://snapsvg.io) library with Javascript, but everyone is now clamoring for Figma. Lately, I enjoy creating data visualizations with D3 and Svelte. So, I would be right in listing Aldus Freehand, Macromedia Freehand, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch and Figma and SVG on my resume. Does that really have anything to do with what I can or do create?

Acronyms are cool. I would love to have acronyms on my resume.

My resume of late has become a list of not even acronyms—initialisms. Just a reminder before we get started: acronyms can be pronounced. PHP is not an acronym; it is an initialism. Scuba and radar are acronyms. Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus is a mouth-full. SCUBA. Radio Detection and Ranging is RADAR. Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation is LASER. LOL and BTW and IMHO—none of them are acronyms or remotely clever. They are initialisms, which is just a pathetic way to not be clear about your communication.

My mother used to tell me that the problem with the word 'fuck' wasn't that it was grotesque—the problem was that it was a sorry excuse for a synonym. Surely, if you were going to be a writer of any salt, you could do better than 'fuck'. And this is how I feel about modern software. Surely, you could do better than think that a framework is a language. Like it or not, the programming language of the World Wide Web (a term lost on us) is going to be Javascript. Bye bye Java Swing UI.

But that's just it. I've been writing Javascript since its inception, and it used to be pretty useless. We used to have to protect ourselves from browsers, search and sniff them out to figure what parts of the user interface they might serve. We called it DHTML—Dynamic HyperText Markup Language—an initialism, not an acronym. Nothing to pronounce here.

And now my resume is made of HTML5, CSS3, JSX, SVG, AIML, GraphQL, SwiftReact, Gatsby, Vue, Svelte, Jquery, PostCSS, Semantic UI, Laravel/Lumen, Node/NPM, Webpack, Docker, Git, JQ, Redux, Apollo, D3, Threejs, Snap.svg, PixiJS

A different list:

Data visualization, diagramming, calculus, Bayesian statistics, regular expression construction, bezier curve mathematics, illustration, design systems, storyboarding, animation, usability and human machine interaction research, technical and scientific writing

These are skills, not acronyms.

Writing alone—the idea of creating a narrative—is insanely complicated and video game designers fail at it constantly.

And none of it remotely describes what I can do.
