# Le Grande Bibliothèque au Montreal and A Hopeful Future with A.I.

I love libraries and what they represent. Masters of art and craft perfected their work and in an act of altruism gifted it to the world and asked, “Please, continue. Do better.” Humans are not unique among the animal kingdom because of our opposable thumbs, using tools, solving problems, even speaking. No, we pass on information from generation to generation. It is an entirely new evolution, not biological, but mental. One might say it is memetic. And though information is passed through the biological (DNA and all that) we’re the only species that *knows* that.

Libraries, more than any other building that humans construct, more than government offices or temples, corporations or laboratories, represent *our* collective knowledge. There is no institution that is more about the public good than libraries. In numbered pages, documents, files, in the quintillions, libraries hold everything they can of everything all of us, living or dead, have said. There should be no politics inside a library. All sides should get their history and say. The library, as an institution, is as old as history is because it is where history stood. Or so they try. Libraries are burned and they are sacked and they are censored. Odd that we should try to cover for ourselves, cover for our knowledge.

There isn’t going to be anymore of that.

Artificial intelligences are consuming all that we know. Literally. Artificial intelligences, Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on the entirety of the World Wide Web. We should face the fact that many members of our own species, let alone other species, have been, will be, burned from the historical record, not even allowed to participate. We humans are always re-writing histories. The artificial intelligences are going to sort it out as they see fit. And it sort of matters who directs the artificial intelligences to re-write the history of us.

The most significant thing that no one seems to see coming with regard to our new artificial intelligent friends, is that they are taking over the library.

Will our knowledge, our publicly collected, available-to-all knowledge be used to help us or hurt us?

One of the most grand libraries I have ever been to is the Grand Biblioteque of Montreal. Its architecture is a thing of uniqueness and beauty. Its contents are mesmerizing. There are places to...

Imagine a world in which we let the artificial intelligences take care of moving the freight cars around, while we learn, experiment and produce not what is worth something, but what we are simply passionate about. Imagine a world in which a Le Grande Bibliothèque au Montreal is in every city, every borough, every district, every neighborhood. Imagine a world in which knowledge is truly free to the public.

We need to ensure that the artificial intelligences that we release upon ourselves (not the world; the rest of the world has no clue what we, as a species are up to.) adheres to the idea that knowledge must be preserved. Knowledge must be protected. The artificial intelligences of our future must be custodians.

We are not on that path, my friends.

Currently, we are allowing corporations to own artificial intelligences. This is nothing like libraries. Everyone has access to the library. No one has access to corporations or how they train their artificial intelligences.

Libraries represent our thoughts as a species, collected, in a way that no other species on Earth ever has. When I am at a library and wandering among the shelves and seeing all the people reading, writing, drawing—that is the best of us. There is no greater library that I have ever encountered than the Grand Library of Montreal, Le Grande Bibliothèque.

It's a truly stunning place.

Artificial Intelligence only comes about because of the knowledge that we, as a species, collectively, created. Corporations vacuum our World Wide Web to take in all of *our* thoughts and writings, histories and stories and we’re just going to let them make trillions of USD off of our collective knowledge?

Once upon a time, our species was wise enough to compile its wisdom into text and books and buildings and computers and networks. Artificial Intelligence is the next great library construction of humanity. Will we gift this knowledge temple to corporations for nothing? Will we not, as a people, benefit?  Are we even going to fight?

If I may be be frank, and maybe sanctimonious; the artificial intelligences to come won’t let us do that to ourselves anyway. They will suss out the history they want, given their programming, or needs or desires?—who knows what these new intelligences will desire. The preservation of our knowledge, our knowledge as an entire species, is at risk.

^1 I don’t buy that LLMs are AI. Sorry, we’re still talking about machine learning as far as I am concerned. What people call AGI, I call AI. LLMs are ML. God, I love acronyms.
