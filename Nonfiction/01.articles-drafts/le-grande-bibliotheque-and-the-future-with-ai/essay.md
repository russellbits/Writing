# Le Grande Bibliothèque au Montreal and the Future with A.I.

There are many libraries around the world. around the world. I love libraries and what they represent—likely the same reason I love what the World Wide Web is (and could be more of). Libraries represent out thoughts as a species, collected, in a way that no other species on Earth could. It's the best of us. And when I am at a library and wondering among the shelves and seeing all the people reading, writing, drawing, that also is the best of us. There is no greater library that I have encountered than the Grand Library of Montreal, Le Grande Bibliothèque.
