# AI AI Paired Coding is Changing Everything

![I used women in honor of the fact that the first programmer was woman: Ada Lovelace. She wrote what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be executed by a machine.](./images/ai-paired-programming.jpg)

At the urging of a friend of mine, I downloaded and installed the Windsurf IDE. I was very familiar with the many extensions in VS Code that can help with whatâ€™s called code completion. Since ChatGPT 3, I had used it to write functions that I couldn't be bothered with, like anything to do with dates and time ðŸ™„.[^1] I was familiar with Co-Pilot, the AI from Microsoftâ€™s Github, which was fantastic at answering questions and helping with boring tasks like renaming or reorganizing file directories. Windsurf felt different and it has given me a lot to think about where we go from here.

Since I tend to look at things on this Substack from a MacLuhanian perspective, Iâ€™ll try it with this concept, but Iâ€™ll admit itâ€™s a bit difficult. Itâ€™s easy to see that television is an extension of vision or that the telephone is an extension of speech. So what about an AI agent that is helping us? Itâ€™s really an extension of our thinking? That seems unnecessarily complex.

Part of the problem becomes about thinking about perception versus thinking, of which thinking is an umbrella over perception. Perception is a kind of thinking. Thereâ€™s external and internal perception, seeing an elephant versus having the memory of one. Thereâ€™s nothing the AI agent can do that I couldnâ€™t, itâ€™s just that in many cases it would take me longer as I might have to look something up or scratch out a solution on paper. Itâ€™s a bit like thatâ€”doodling a solution.
