# A Little Cantina on the Edge of Nowhere
### (Prompt: How These 5/10 Minutes of ‘X’ Movie/Show Defined the Franchise.)

When Obi-wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker arrive at the cantina in Mos Eisley, the audience learns a lot about the Star Wars universe. The scene in the cantina might inform the audience about the general galaxy more than any other scene in the film, and therefor the rest of the cannon as well.  The audience of "A New Hope," prior to the cantina, knows there's an empire, soldiers and lords, senators, and princesses, but we haven't seen the underbelly of the galaxy, yet.

It turns out, much, much later in the fiction, after the fall of the Empire, that the underbelly of the galaxy is pretty significant! There are criminal organizations and bounty hunters, smugglers and pirates. There are all manner of alien species all over the galaxy up to their own thing totally on the fringe of whatever ruling party exists. Even the empire never really manages to get these groups completely under its thumb, preferring to bribe these groups, or use them.

So much of this chaos is revealed in the cantina. We see more alien species than at any point in the film so far. In fact, the only alien species in the film prior to the cantina are the Jawas and Tusken Raiders.[^1] While we've learned about the existence of droids, the Catina offers the first opportunity for the audience to see that they're not universally loved; not even allowed in some places. The scene is full of raucous music and two more critical elements: the existence of pirates and the fact that, while described as noble, Jedi don't have to be nice.

The cantina scene, from its irresistible earworm of a jazz soundtrack, to the crazy cuts between utterly bizarre busts of creatures no one had seen before, is paramount to illustrating what Star Wars is as we work of fiction. Beyond the samurai-like warriors of Darth Vader and the Stormtroopers, and our droid guides, Star Wars is a Western where anyone can start a fight with you, for no reason at all, and it could be deadly. One of the great things about *A New Hope* is that it's got stakes. People can die, and the cantina goes a long way to demonstrating just how dangerous this galaxy can be.

[^1]: These two groups are actually not even technically aliens, since both originate from Tatooine. If anyone is alien on Tatooine, it's the humans.



# Other Pitches

## How do Jawas transport Sandcrawlers in space?
We know they do. We've seen Jawa now on multiple planets throughout the franchise. Are there any clues as to how this happens?
## Can Dave Filoni thoroughly unite his part of the galaxy with the Skywalker franchise?
There's been plenty of crossover between the Skywlaker saga and Dave Filoni's major contributions (*The Clone Wars*, *Rebels*, *The Book of Boba Fett*). Is there hope that he can find balance between "fan service" and a solid intersection of plot between "Ahsoka" and the final three films of the Skywalker saga.
## How Star Wars Fans Love Explaining Craft with Fiction
Star Wars fans can go out off their way to explain the way things are in the Star Wars galaxy while completely ignoring the necessities that actually made the fiction the way it was. Is it just love or denial?
## Why is Tatooine so Important?
We just keep coming back to this planet again and again. Is there something about Tatooine that nobody knows? There are hints in *The Book of Boba Feet* that suggest that Tatooine use to be quite different.
## The Balance of the Force
There's a great deal of dispute about "the prophecy"; namely, was it supposed to be Anakin that brought balance and did he do it? The new Ahsoka series seems to hint at a new perspective: that maybe Anakin *is* the balance.
