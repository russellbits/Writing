# A Cabin With Walls That Are Not There

A while ago I went to a cabin in the woods. And yes, it was the spooky kind. I went to the cabin during a multiple-day rainstorm, and an attempt to escape binging on alcohol. There was no way to get the drink there, and the woods were misty and there was thunder in the air and the cabin was quiet and there was no one around. The worst horror of all: no cell phone signal, no wifi, ergo no internet. The disconnection! The loneliness! Good lord, who wants to be alone with my thoughts. Reflecting on it, I bet a few.

I’m sure we all know the movie tropes about cabins that are in woods that are misty and where there is some dark energy out there in those woods trying to get in. I, however, discovered that the spooky was in my own mind. In the movies, the characters are always trapped in the spooky cabin, while evil tries to get inside. In reality, the spooky is on the fiber, the phone lines, the web sites, and the silence of the cabin is only frightening because it’s quiet, at least not the kind of quiet that doesn’t stress us out because there is not a reply. Ever.

 There was nothing in particular spooky about the cabin. The very thick walls made of massive lumber were quite comforting.
