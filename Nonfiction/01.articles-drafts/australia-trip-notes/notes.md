Bare Island (fort)
https://bit.ly/3T1vuoB
Time Out says:
The government of the day built an elaborate fort on this island 30 metres off the coast of La Perouse in the early 1880s, seeing the land Cook had described a century earlier as “a small bare island” as a good place to ward off invaders.

Island hop? You can tour the historical island Sundays at 1.30pm, 2.30pm and 3.30pm ($15 for adults). The surrounding reefs are a hot spot for local divers.
