Foothills trail notes

Things I wish I had:
Tuke 
Long-sleeved shirt
Correct propane tank (1/2 size)
Cord 

Things that turned out to be a godsend!
Headlamp
Lifestraw (that just happens to fit in my canteen!)
Camelpack 
My Dickies 
Elastic waisted pants!
Quick-drying clothing is a must!

Some notions
Could you cook electrically with USB? And a big enough battery?
The solar panels hang on the pack great, but the phone goes on and off constantly which I think bad for it. If you had a battery on the panels all day and then charged at night—perfect!

An experiment: would the lifestraw filter out look-aid?

It’s amazing how many things you forget when you’re basically out in the woods doing nothing.

I don’t know if it’s just me and my brain, but I’ve experienced this before. Streams and creeks can sound like people talking in the distance.

Day 1
Set off from Sasafras. Dad dropped me off around noon. This was the right idea; downhill from the offset. Problem is, even going downhill this pack is too heavy. Need to be ten pounds lighter. I list through items and try to distill what could maybe get ditched.

I have to laugh because while I descend, twice I cross the road that Dad and I drove up to get to Sasafras. I laugh that wouldn’t it be weird if I cross in front him. And I also realize he should dropped me off there, had either of us known, since I got such a late start.

At one of the road crossings I pass a nice couple. We stay hi. Later on, not more than 200 yards on, I pass a red-headed bearded guy with a day pack. He says, “Lovely day!” And I say, “It sure is!” And I decide in that moment that that’s what I will say to people going forward. It was just refreshing; better than most protocol conversation.

[The big rock fort!]

Had to stop at a random spot. It was getting to be twilight and I just didn’t have confidence I was going to make it to [flat rock?] in time. It was here that I discovered that my propane tank did not fit my stove top. Ok. There’s something I can ditch tomorrow at a camp site. It sucks not to have a stove but I know how to boil water on a fire.

I’m stopped along the trail when the couple from the road passes me again. I guess they went up the mountain and then down again. I say, “Hello again.” But they’re conversing and I get the feeling that they don’t recognize me from the road. Then, as planned, I say, “Lovely day.” And the woman responds, “Good! How are you?” I love it when protocol conversation just goes bottoms up.

[Deciding to stop nowhere in particular and yet finding rusted cans.]

Day 2
I get up in the morning, eat a simple dry breakfast. The problem with this unmarked camp site is that there’s no water. I’m going to have to stop at the first spot I find. Curiously, I pee orange this morning. I’m not sure why.

While I’m packing, three guys with walking sticks and camel packs go whooshing by. I mean, they are moving. They don’t see me.

Continuing along Horse Pasture road. So weird, there were cars up and down until at least 10pm. Doing what? At one point in the night I heard dogs barking which freaked me out a bit. Honestly I’m more afraid of humans in the wilderness than I am the wilderness itself.

I’m sore, but not too bad. My left heal and my right toes have bothered me a lot in the last few years. But A strange thing happened when I was taking care of my cousins dogs: the more I walked the less it bothered me. I’m hoping that will be the case here. I do wish I’d thought to bring Aleve though. I have Advil and Tylenol but they’re it quite cutting it.

I spot a snake on the trail before I get to a nice little site, that I think at first is flat rock. It’s brown and darker brown and checkered; pretty big. There’s no easy way around it. I look to see if it has venom pockets and I can’t really tell. To my memory this is a copperhead. I decide just to throw stuff at it in the hopes that it will move on. It does not. It gets into a striking pose. Shit. I climb up the bank, clamber over a few feet and drop down on the other side of it. Idiot is still looking at where I was. I pick up a rock and throw it him for good measure and miss completely.

Right after the snake I get to a nice flat camp site that looks like it could be Flat Rock. I’m starting to realize I’m good at orients but bad at hiding distances. Anyway, it’s a good spot for lunch. A troop of five backpackers go by and don’t see me. Is this a trend?

I stop at what is called Laurel Creek Falls camp site, but will find at tomorrow that it IS NOT. Who would put up a fake sign? Dawkins Flat, my new goal, was a mere 300 yards away. Blerg!

I got a fire going, but like the night before, the wood is damp and the fire is shitty.

Day 3
Pretty flat stuff down to Laurel Creek Falls. GOD Laurel Creek Falls camp site—the REAL one is super nice. It’s right above the falls too. WTF!? I totally could’ve made it here yesterday. Damn.

The hills start as I pass the falls. Gorgeous. Beautiful. Three, Four stories? I want to jump in and shower in them but they’re pretty inaccessible.

Heartbreak ridge. 254 stairs. Waiting at the bench when two dogs show up long before their masters.

I’m at Toxaway. HEAVEN. There are fire pits with grills and tables and a pole with a hook where you can hang your sack! There is the most luscious of rapids going into Jocasee and I have my pick of the camp sites. No one else here!

Day 4
I’m sad to leave Toxaway. I seriously contemplated just staying for the day. 

I’m at Bear Creek. I have seen bear tracks and also there is a bear sack cable here. Hmm. I know about how to scare bears off in a field or on the trail. I don’t know squat about what to do when lying in a hammock in the middle of the night.

I’ve heard them for ages, but owl calls always freak me out. I even know it’s an owl! Doesn’t matter. It’s a shock and it starts my heart racing. Every time.

Day 5
Best day yet. Best time made. Best conversation with other hikers. Best fire!

Started this morning at Bear Creek. Once again, a fog had rolled in and the whole little dale was just dewy. For a minute I thought it was raining, but in fact the sky (what you could see of it) was pure blue again (how unbelievably lucky with the weather have I been!?) and it was just the damp collecting and falling off the trees in rays of sunlight too shy coming over the hills to make past all the foliage.

 Was down in a ditch, so the morning started off with a hearty ascent. I can’t figure if I prefer to start the day with an ascent or end it with one. Luckily for me, I got both!

It wasn’t long before I came across a gent sitting on a log. I stopped to chat. He was from Boiling Springs SC and made bear statues with chainsaws. We don’t get five minutes into it when two dogs wearing packs show up, quickly followed by two young woman. They join the confab and are from Louisville! I mention my association. 

Then, the gent on the log asks if he can interview us. He likes doing this for his private YouTube channel. He says it’s only for friends and family but that somehow it’s gotten 800 subscribers. He seemed genuinely remorseful when he said, “I don’t know how.” And you know, there was something about his voice, the timbre, it just sounded like someone I knew or maybe some country singer I like.

The brief party broke up. Since they were all going the other way, I told them about Toxaway and Heartbreak ridge and the 254 steps. They looked politely daunted, but then when your going that way, your plan is to end your trip climbing Sasafras and Table Rock. After they parted I wondered about why so many people were going in the direction opposite me. I figure if you’ve never been to SC or if this is your one trip on the trail, you want to end your trip with those awesome views. Me, I’ve seen them many times. I’m out here just to be out here. I’d just assume roll downhill.

Given that my plan was pretty much shot up since day 1, I mostly just move from camp to camp, keep up my pace, stop and stare at anything that catches my attention, and see how I feel about getting to the next place.

At [Bear Creek Camp] I sat for a late lunch and for once, a man came passing me going in the same direction! He was olde than me but I can’t say by how much. He was from Hartsville, GA. He out in on Monday! Holy carp; he made a day and half on me and then some.

He mentioned a man behind him, maybe Chris, who had a gossamer bag… or equipment. I’d never heard of such a thing, but I figured if I saw the guy, I’d ask. Chances were good he’d pass me too.

These hard-core packers, so spry and with their walking sticks, we’ll, they’re fine. But boy do they make my out-of-shape ass feel out-of-shape. When I get off the trail, one thing that’s got to change is my health. I want to do more of this! I figure 10% more strength, 20% improved constitution, and a pack that’s 10 pounds lighter and I’ll be zooming too! Not too much to ask of myself.

This is my second time on the trail and the first time was a bit of a bust. I got lost. I wore cotton socks and got bad blisters. I had no map, just a list of places. I tell you, if I hadn’t turned around on the third day, those mountains would’ve tore me up. You live, you learn. I’ve learned a lot this time too. Who knows, maybe the third time’s the charm! Doing the trail again and recognizing old familiar landmarks and knowing where I’d want to stop for a day and swim (Toxaway, duh). I think that would just make the trail better. Maybe I could drag my cousin with me. And a dog. I find it hilarious that the dogs often find you minutes before their masters. And I love the ones that wear little packs of their own.

Going the opposite direction of so many others has been fun, really. You get to act as a kind of guide. Wait till you see this, watch out for that snake, 254 stairs! It’s been fun. Definitely, the little huddles on the trail are nice.

The ascent up to Hillyard falls was filled with expletives and moaning. One, I just swear I looked at  the map very carefully before setting out and saw nothing like the ascent I had to go up. PLUS, this one sign said “Hillyard Falls 0.2” but I couldn’t *hear* any falls. I feel like I should be able hear big falls from 0.2 miles away. Whatever, I’ve pretty much established that I’m pretty terrible with distances. And I would’ve thought that was the longest 0.2 miles ever except I just all of sudden arrived at Coley Creek! There must’ve been some turn-off for Hillyard Falls and I missed completely amidst all my grumbling. Finally, spiders that make their webs in the trail; fuck those guys. There’s a billion pairs of trees around, but NoO, they gotta’ build their shit in the path and at eye level. I don’t think they’re trying to catch bugs at all. It’s clearly a dare from other spiders. “I bet you can’t catch one of those apes that matches through here.” “Yeah? Watch me.” And then house later, “Oh God! What have I done!” as I use Gnar to tear though their glistening annoyances. Pricks. Some of them even have the audacity to try to hutch a ride on you. Nope.

[Anyway, the best night eve at Coley Creek, the big fire, burning pants, turning the hammock into the best ever lounge chair and shouting at Hickory Trees, “You missed me!” or “Okay that was close.” And OHMYGOD the stars!]

Day 6
Back to Cackalacky, sort of
