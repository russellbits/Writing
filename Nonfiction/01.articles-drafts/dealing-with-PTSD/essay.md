It took me two years at University of Lousiville to figure out why it was troubling for me to not run some days from my 8am classes. (I was teaching them, p.s.) But some days I just felt total panic. Mind you, I have been on a stage in front of people since the age of five, so it made no sense. It made no sense until a therapist, a good man by the name of Leo Wilson talked with me and put two and two together. There are a lot of planes that fly over the University of Louisville and they fly low. And loud. And you sort of don't notice. Here's the thing: I was walking down West Broadway (I think) when the second plane hit the towers. I couldn't see it, but I felt it. I heard it. I think everyone around me did. What happened next, I still don't want to explain. But it shook me to my bones. It shook my bones so hard that years later, years later, it still fucks with me. Leo Wilson pointed out: maybe the planes flying over the school are bothering you.
