# User Interface Architecture

## Architecture is not just a useful metaphor for user interface design.

## User interface design is architecture.

Like a building, human-computer  interfaces should have clearly designed entrances and exits, accepted desire paths, not overwhelm human working memory, and be beautiful to look at.

Human-computer interfaces go beyond the responsibilities of physical architecture though, because they have the capacity to interact—to respond. While a building can inform and illicit emotion, a human-computer interface can respond—talk back.

So, not unlike Asimov’s rules for robotics, a human-computer interface has responsibilities beyond the physical and emotional of buildings should obey three rules:

1. A UI should polite
2. A UI should be transparent
3. A UI should be joyful

### Polite
Experiment
1.1 It should never willfully or accidentally allow the destruction of human data.
1.2 It should blame a human for an error in its programming.
Memory
Decision Flows
> Why ask the user to press a button when one isn't even needed?

### Transparent
Experiment
Clear Tools
Clear Goals
Reduced Preferences - users do not want to design interfaces.

### Joyful
Experiment
Would you rather work with this Ui or this one? Did you first ask what the user was meant to do? Are some tasks somber?

### 1. Goals

### 2. Techniques
2.1 What is information architecture
2.2 What is a component
2.3 What is data visualization - there is no such thing as information design—why not?
2.4 What is a wireframe?

### 3. Measurement
A/B measurement is useless.
