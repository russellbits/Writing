In the midst of a Presidential election of [who could care less, or who could be worse](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/)?—mass killings that no [congressional sit-in can seem to stem](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/house-democrats-sit-in-guns/488444/), and the dawning of our [robot overlords](https://next.ft.com/content/063c1176-d29a-11e5-969e-9d801cf5e15b), comes a [new edit](http://collider.com/batman-v-superman-ultimate-edition-review/) of a barely new film, [barely liked](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice/) for all of us to glower over five times, scrutinize until it's not fun anymore—and it's about a Prometheus beating down a God—I say, good timing! I mean, what better way to celebrate our individual political powerlessness than with a good hard look at what the [nouveau riche](http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2013/09/16/the-youngest-billionaires-on-the-forbes-400-20-under-45/#543c523e2053) likely intends to comically do to themselves with comical amounts of money?

This haggard, tired Superman—[unsure of his responsibility to those of lesser power](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot)—versus the good old Kansas-boy Superman who looks after everyone he can—is a good reflection for all of us. This Batman that is militant in his service of personal "justice" that knows [no bounds](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/123255/how-many-people-each-do-batman-and-superman-kill-in-bvs-dawn-of-justice), armed with every weapon [the Pentagon would like to get its hands on](http://www.defensetech.org/2015/06/04/air-forces-batman-drops-in-at-pentagon-lab-day/), versus the detective Batman that hid in the shadows but always believed the American Order side of Law and Order was good enough to put the bad guys away—any number of times—is good for us, too. They're not the heroes we need, but they are the ones we deserve.  Justice is now beyond the hands of the public. This isn't the comic's Batman and Superman, this is Holywood's Batman and Superman, and now they are heroes that can be sold to international audiences; not the believers. Now they can stand for despots, because that's what they've been captured as; not heroes, just powerful elites.

Well, that's fine. Sell everything we believe in, Hollywood—you were always a whore anyway. Zack Snyder's Supermman is a [Neoliberalist](), whining about his power while failing to recognize that he inherited it in the first place, powerful beyond geographic boundaries, and Zack Synder's Batman is a Neofascist, a dictator in a small and trod upon territory, branding his enemies with symbols—nazi-like—something the classic Batman would never do.

As a fan of both of these heroes, I cringe at the mutations, but then these are myths, not facts, and myths are meant to teach us things about culture, not the world. Zack Snyder's ideas about these heroes are just as valid as the original writers—it's just that Mr. Snyder lives in a bubble, and don't we all these days?

Maybe you didn't know that there was a battle between [Neoliberalism and Neofascism](https://youtu.be/zXtnOXD-NwA)?—no worries. No one would fault you, because no one on TV even talks about it. I suppose it's because the "news" is more concerned with more [important things](), like advertising! But then, it *could be* that the news is powned—sorry, that's gamer speak for that fact that [6 corporations own 90% of the media](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6). But we can trust in those news organizations jingoistic leanings in order to know that they aren't using [newspeak](http://orwell.ru/library/novels/1984/english/en_app). Because, you know, George Orwell was an idiot. The idea that our media could usurp our democracy is silly—especially if our media were entirely bought. But that will never happen, right?

It's just that this Neoliberal v. Neofascism debate has an escape valve that is perpendicular to the stupid two-dimensional schism that is Neoliberalism vs Neofascism and that's anti-bullshit or what might otherwise be known as transparency. It' Wonder Woman's lasso of truth that is really required here. Batman and Superman can beat down anyone who resists, but Wonder Woman [just embarrasses her opponents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s4nkPZsH_E).

If the United States of America was ever about anything it was surely about speaking truth to power. Question: Where does the power lay these days? Congress? Ha! The Presidency? [Laughable](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/freakonomics-radio-how-much-does-the-president-really-matter/).

People just don't have enough experience around the 1% that are sociopaths. It's unfortunate. They're not all sociopaths, but the ones that are treat power like a drug and this Lex Luthor was played like a junky. Maybe a lot of us don't experience with that either but the fact is it was played well by Jesse Eiseneburg. he know exactly how to play a billionaire with no restraint. You think Trump, in the privacy of his own home isn't equally uncomfortabele? You have missed a lot of video.
