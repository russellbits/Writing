# What is Interface Architecture

Architecture is not just a useful metaphor for user interface design.

User interface design is architecture.

Like a building, a human-computer interface[^1] should have clearly designed entrances and exits, accepted desire paths[^2], not overwhelm human working memory, and be beautiful to look at.

Human-computer interfaces go beyond the responsibilities of physical architecture though, because they have the capacity to interact—to respond. While a building can inform and even illicit emotion, a human-computer interface can literally respond—can talk back, either through text or speech.

Our digital lives, just like our real lives, have entrances and exits, foolish handles, circular paths, and other stupid inefficiencies. Moreover, it’s about to get worse as our digital lives and our real lives begin to collide (overlap if you are an optimist). The unfortunate fact is, our real life architecture is still in its infancy. Now, there is a new horizon.

## Principles for HCI Architecture

Not unlike Asimov’s rules for robotics, a human-computer interface should obey three rules. Just to review for non-science fiction fans, the three rules of robotics were formulated by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. They are designed to ensure that robots behave in a safe and ethical manner. The laws are:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

I believe that HCIs require similar priorities, though I have a different approach from Asimov.

1. A HCI should be polite
2. A HCI should be transparent
3. A HCI should be joyful

### A Human-computer Interface should be Polite

No one appreciates being told that the `Error: XML library is not located in the proper system location` or `Error: Not found:/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png`. These statements are meaningless to individuals little to no computer programming experience.

There is a potentially odd exception to this rule: when a user wants to be treated gruffly or rudely. I am reminded of theme restaurants where the wait staff is meant to be rude and insult customers in a kind of satire performance.

### A Human-computer Interface Should be Transparent

The working memory of the human mind is capable of being aware of 5 + or - 2 “chunks” of information. Asking users to make decisions between more than this can result in attention overload and in general, the user is likely to  abandon the task at hand.

The goal of any human-computer interaction should be for the interface to get out of the way of the desire path of the user.

### A Human-computer Interface Should be Joyful

It is important to engage users’ dopamine release with a hierarchy of sound, music, color and animation. Sometimes called gamification, a more basic concept is simply that success with any task should be rewarded not just with the completion of the task, but some celebration.

Why shouldn’t computer-human interactions be a joyful interaction? They are so more often frustrating, when joy can encouraged repeated use and a general alleviation of stress.

## Tactics

In landscape architecture, it is often noted that there are paths created in the landscape not necessarily created by the architect, but rather the patrons. 

Buildings are hard to change. Human-computer interfaces are not. These six tools can help to plan, but they cannot answer the question of what people want from their interactions with software. These tools are an excellent place to start.

### 1. User Research
2. Information Architecture
3. 

# Notes
+ Should discuss skeuomorphism at some point.


[^1]: It should be noted that throughout this essay I will use some terms interchangeably.

[^2]: Desire paths are a somewhat obscure landscape architecture term that is highly useful to keep in mind when architecting a human-computer interface. As opposed to where the architect has placed paths, where are users going?
