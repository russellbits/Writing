### Subject:
Cognitive Science and Media, i.e. “Our Minds on Media”

### Your proposal for a new Psychology Today blog:
What is happening to our minds on media? I would like to contribute a blog that explores how media and technology are shaping our collective psyche. As a software and web developer with a background in cognitive science and human-computer interaction, I aim to examine the psychological effects of new media through a technological lens. As Marshall McLuhan was, I am inspired by the concept that all media are extensions of the human body and brain. With modern neuroscience, we now know there are a great many more senses than the five senses McLuhan was examining.

Psychology has long considered the influences of nature and nurture, but we are now increasingly shaped by algorithms, simulations, and artificial intelligence. As technology continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, the public needs greater awareness of both the benefits and risks these new media present. My goal is to provide insightful, research-backed discussions on how digital environments affect cognition, behavior, and mental well-being.

### Why you want to start this blog now:
Concerns about the effects of media on the mind are not new. As a child, I became aware of this through my interest in comic books and the history of the Comics Code Authority—established in 1954 by the comics industry in response to public outcry over violent and controversial content. Over time, I observed similar societal reactions to rock and roll, rap music, and role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons.

Today, we see this pattern repeating with emerging media like social networks, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. However, beyond cultural anxieties, there is a growing body of research showing real psychological impacts: digital addiction, FOMO (fear of missing out), and the blurring boundaries between online and offline identity. As Marshal McLuhan famously pointed out in his seminal book "Understanding Media," "the medium *is* the message". From social media scrolling to smartphone usage, we see effects on sleep, stress levels, and overall well-being. And these new media are arriving with unprecedented speed.

For example, ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months—five times faster than TikTok and ten times faster than Instagram. AI-driven media, algorithmic content curation, and immersive virtual spaces are rapidly becoming a dominant force in our daily lives. With these rapid shifts, there is an urgent need to understand not just *what* these technologies do but *how* they shape our thoughts, emotions, and social interactions. Informing more of the public at large about the potential psychological effects of new media would be of great service.

### Why you are qualified to be the author of this blog:
I began my career on the web (not knowing it) at the age of 18. This was 1993, when the web was brand new. In fact, I have the rare distinction of surfing the *entirety* of the World Wide Web—every site on Yahoo! at the time—with Mosaic on a Sun SPARCstation in my father’s math computer lab at Clemson University. I have since been fascinated with the distribution of information, the speed of that distribution and its effects on us and our society. 

I have a Master's degree in psychology from the University of Louisville where I specialized in computational cognitive science. I have also been a computer and web software developer for decades and have closely studied matters like human-computer interaction and usability in the field. I have spent many years studying media, researching the effects of media on psychology and writing about it on my own blog, Banapana.com and Medium.com (https://medium.com/minds-on-media). Writing for a blog on PsychologyToday.com would be a much improved way to get the word out, and I would greatly appreciate any editorial oversight. In lieu of contributing to or maintaining a blog, I would also value being able to contribute to any existing column or blog that "Psychology Today" already has.
