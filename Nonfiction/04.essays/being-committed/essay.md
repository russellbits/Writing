Time is like a millipede in this place; each leg a moment swinging as the tiny series of shell sectionals bends across a vast terrain that from the point of its myopic antenna is both infinite and nondescript.

Except for the code oranges...

Maybe on the fourth day of my own stay, Malieke was there in our room. He was standing by the windows and broke out in song. He had quite a nice voice. He sang a few bars and then to my shock turned to me and said, "Do you know that song?"
"No. It's nice though."
"You don't know that song?"
"Nope. Sorry."
"It's an old one."
He turned back to the window and I figured we were done. But then he started rapping—just for a few minutes. It was like that thing he kept mumbling to himself over and over, came out. It seemed like relief.
I said, "Is that yours?"
"Naw."
Again, he looked out the windows. He started rubbing his head like usual. He walked away from the windows towards the door and stopped in front of our trash can—which he did not use. He turned to me, lying on my bed, "Do you know how old I am?"
"No," I replied. And that was an honest assessment. Put him in a business suit instead of pajamas and I still wouldn't have known.
"I'm forty-one."
"Guess what?"
"What?"
"I'm forty-six!"
He smiled. We both chuckled. "We look young." He said with the comforting smooth voice of a jazz musician being an MC.
"Well, Thanks."
"We got the gray but we look young."



August 13

What a weird, strange wonderful day. I wrote the narrative down on the legal pad and part of that was some of the most honest writing I've done in years.

GRATITUDE
1. The roof!
2. Dominos
3. Listening to the legend of Lancaster's birth (if that is even his name)

August 15 (Tiny Pancakes)
There was an entry for 8/14. That was the day I got the download from Nicolle about what really happened that Saturday night. (8/6).

August 15 (day 9) (moon beam)
Went to the gym today. Yay. Freeman shut me out at HORSE. He was strangely competitive about it, but then I'm not built like that. And even worse, I was really off my game. I know I can shoot better than that. Maybe he was intimidating me.

Professor Dawson gave a health lecture on Hep C. It was just for me. All of the violets made entrances and exits.
She has the same wonky finger.
She had also attempted suicide. Is it possible to judge someone else's suicide attempt against your own? Of course it is, but that really seems like an object lesson in futility.
