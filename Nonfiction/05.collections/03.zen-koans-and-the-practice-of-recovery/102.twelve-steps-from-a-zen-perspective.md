## The Twelve Steps From A Zen Perspective



### Step 1
“We admitted that we were powerless over our addiction, that our lives had become unmanageable.”

Getting through denial is the essence of the first step. First, you must admit that you have a problem.

However, I could not get past the word “powerless.” And I couldn’t get over it for strangely dichotomous reasons. One, if I am admiring that things are not as I want them and I am engaging the steps to get help, then how am I powerless? The statement is paradoxical. How did we come to this state of powerlessness if not by choice? How did our lives becomes unmanageable if we had not chosen to allow it? Two, I don’t believe in free will, but I’ll get back to that later. 

I found powerless to be a poor choice of words. What I was not  doing was admitting that I needed help. I tried to fix myself many times. I tried to abstain. Seeking help and being powerless may seem synonymous to some, but that is a sad fact of our culture’s pick-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps delusional thinking. Taking the step to ask for help is actually quite empowering. Going in to a rehab program helped me see the advantage of being around people who were already familiar with my struggle. There was no need to mince words or hide my feelings; they already knew where I was coming from. Some of them were on the road ahead of me and seeing their successes and getting their earnest encouragement gave me hope.

So, for myself, I re-formulated Step 1 thusly:

### Zen Step 1
We admit our choices were making our lives unmanageable  because our desires had become overpowering.

This re-formulation accomplishes something important for me.  The step is no longer paradoxical. We must make up our own minds that we are out of control. Again, the first step is admitting that you have a problem of your thinking. You are choosing to see that you are making poor choices. This requires choice. Choose to continue on and face the consequences or see that the consequences are not what you desire and choose change.

Other steps contained ideas that I also found paradoxical and difficult.

### Zen Step 2
“We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.”

I do not consider addiction to be insanity. I do not consider living with an addiction to be insanity. We like to colloquially define insanity as “Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” but that’s not really what the addict is doing. We are getting exactly the results we want by doing more and more of the same thing. It’s everything else that is collapsing around us.

As for the matter of a higher power, why higher? What is higher? In the air? Smarter than us? It is a misconception that matters like evolution have a goal; that greater intelligence equals greater. It’s unfortunate not to see the order and calm in that which is small—or lower? With many addicts, deluding ourselves to being a higher power is part of the problem. We fail to see that we have become animalistic machines.

So, I re-formulated Step 2 as

### Zen Step 2
“We sought help from that in nature and those among us who understood order and calm.”

This formulation allows for the sentiment of a higher power without requiring it. There are ways to look at nature and see chaos and choose to emulate that. There are ways to look at nature and see order and choose to emulate that. This is the yin and yang.

This formulation spells out the need for a desire for help, while retaining the ability to do so. It incorporates the idea that our basic choice is to listen. The next step then is to listen.

### Step 3
“We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.”

First and foremost, a niggling detail: Him? Get over it. The inherent chauvinism in this statement is just transparent, let alone the silliness of the idea of an all-powerful metaphysical being of any kind reproducing to make more little baby gods. So It’s an It. But the point is moot.

As I said earlier, this is about making a decision to listen. Pay close attention to the first koan and reflection that I put in this book. “How can I show you what Zen is when your cup is already full? First you must empty your cup.”

### Zen Step 3
We make a decision to give up what we thought we knew and listen to those who can teach and that which can show a new path.

Addiction may not be curable, but it can be curbed, perhaps reversed. Certainly the brain can be physically rehabilitated. We have pictures (MRIs) of that very process occurring over time. Victims of strokes and head trauma can suffer much greater physical injury to the brain than those suffering from addiction and those brains can be rehabilitated. I do not believe that addiction, which causes physical changes in the brain and damage in most cases, is in a category that is different. Rehabilitation is possible.

I also do not believe in anything metaphysical. I believe the Universe to be deterministic. Particles obey the fundamental laws of physics and make atoms and atoms make molecules and proteins are molecules which make cellular creatures which make multicellular creatures and creatures with brains and nowhere in that process is there room for free will. As complicated as the brain is, it is fundamentally physical. In short, There is simply no mechanism that I am aware of for me to give my will to anything; I don’t have it to give. Every choice I ever make was determined at the beginning of the Universe.

Sorry to get heavy, but that’s how I grok the Universe.

However, that may not be true for you. Belief is a powerful thing and it is possible to have faith in the metaphysical if you define faith as belief without evidence. I do believe that belief can have physiological effects. The placebo effect in medicine is a very real phenomenon. If you take two groups of people and give group A sugar pills (or something ineffectual) and group B actual medication, some percentage of group A will gain a benefit or even suffer side effects. [SOURCE] There is even a nocebo effect in which doctors can harm their patients by framing illnesses in a cynical way. [SOURCE]

Belief is personal and powerful. 


Zen Step 1
We admit that our choices were making our lives unmanageable  because our desires had become overpowering.

Zen Step 2
We seek help from that in nature and those among us who understood order and calm.

Zen Step 3
We make a decision to give up what we thought we knew and listen to those who can teach and that which can show.


Step 4
“We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.”

Thus step is pretty all right by me. Morality refers to personal or cultural principles of right and wrong. It is often shaped by religion, upbringing, or personal beliefs. Morality tends to be subjective and varies between individuals or societies. This is appropriate here. Maybe you are a government revolutionary and you realize that your addiction is keeping you from effectively killing as many government soldiers as you should.

Zen Step 4
We make a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.

Zen Step 4
“We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.”

Zen Step 4
“We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.”

There is much about these formulations that are really about order and defeating entropy.
