## The Monks and the Beautiful Traveler

### Burdens

Two monks were hiking a long road. They came to a muddy creek embankment. On the other side was a beautiful traveler clearly afraid to cross because of her beautiful silken dress. The first monk, with little hesitation, made his way across the embankment and offered to carry her back across. She accepted. Once back across, she offered to the first monk thanks and then money. He refused and the two monks went on their way.

The second monk was furious, for their order was forbidden from interacting with women. The two monks continued walking for several miles until the second monk could contain his fury no longer. “How could you carry that woman across the creek bed? You *know* our order is forbidden from interacting with women!”

“Brother,” said the first monk. “I carried her across the creek bed. You have been carrying her for miles.”

We carry our addictions and they are heavy desires. Memories of our past substance use and abuse and daydreams about future use are our burdens. We must remember that we are not our thoughts and when we do so, we can set the thought or urge aside and return to the moment—the *now*. Release your memory or daydream like a dove to the wind and lighten your mind with what beauty you can find before you.
