## Three Monks and the Mind

### The Subtlety of Perception

There were three monks out for a walk. One monk saw a banner flying and remarked on it. “Look at how much the banner is moving.” The second monk said, “It is actually the wind, which cannot be seen, that is moving the banner.” The third monk, the eldest, said, “While you are both correct, what you do not see is the the motion of the banner and the wind is only inside your mind.”

Our addictions are disorders of the brain. Brain imaging of sufferers of addiction show physical damage. The addiction changes the person’s benefit calculus so that more of the substance can be obtained regardless of the physical, property or social damage occurring. Like thirst, the compulsion to obtain and use more of the addictive substance becomes impossible to ignore. If we can see that we are not our thoughts, our compulsions, we can separate the necessary from the pleasurable. We may begin to see that what once was pleasurable had become punishment. By making this new identification of the compulsion, we can begin to learn to disengage from it (them). In a sense, your addiction wants the substance but you know that using the substance can only cause you pain, misfortune and certain death.
