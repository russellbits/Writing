## A Parable

### To savor

A man traveling across a field encountered a tiger. He fled, the tiger after him. Coming to a precipice, he caught hold of the root of a wild vine and swung himself down over the edge. The tiger sniffed at him from above. Trembling, the man looked down to where, far below, another tiger was waiting to eat him. Only the vine sustained him.

Two mice, one white and one black, little by little started to gnaw away the vine. The man saw a luscious strawberry near him. Grasping the vine with one hand, he plucked the strawberry with the other. How sweet it tasted!

When we are not not in recovery, we are in a rush to get our next fix and the next fix brings us closer to death (the first tiger). Death is inevitable (the second tiger) of course, but in the normal course of action, we generally donâ€™t seek it out. Recovery gives us a respite from that rush to death and begins again to let us savor that which is both healthy and truly delicious.
