Remember when Amazon reviews \[were used as a form of absurdist humor\](http://banapana.com/creative-communism/who-knew-amazon-was-entertainment)? The reviews for \[Tuscan milk\](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032G1S0) alone kept me laughing for hours. But that was just a joke. Let's use Amazon reviews to protest something instead! Hey, remember on the news how \[all of those UC Davis students were "protected and served" the shit out of\](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/11/uc-davis-protest-police-pepper-spray.html) with pepper spray? No? Because you can watch the absolute abuse of power \[from multiple angles\](http://waxy.org/2011/11/viewing\_the\_uc\_davis\_pepper\_spraying\_from\_multiple\_angles/). And, guess what? Amazon \[sells the pepper spray\](http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Technology-56895-Stream-Pepper/product-reviews/B0058EOAUE/ref=dp\_top\_cm\_cr\_acr\_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1) used in the videos, and you can review it. Have fun.
