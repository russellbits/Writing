"Information wants to be free," is a classic and slightly anthropomorphized mantra for those that believe that intellectual property is not property at all. The general tone of such a delightfully simple phrase is correct, but its mechanisms are debatable. Is information really "out there" waiting for us to find it, or are we not part of the function of its development---it's very occurrence seems, to me, dependent on our observation. Physicists and engineers did humans a bit of disservice by describing information as something inherent in a signal and not occurring in the reception of data---the interpretation of data is where information resides. Part of the reason that information wants to be free, is that those that utilize it want to spread it. More shortly, humans are gossips and for good reason.

Information outside the brain is not information. That "it" wants to be free fails to see the mechanism that makes any sense of it---gives it meaning, or at least contectulaization.

humans are cooperative beings; we share information.

Consider mathematics: 14th century mathematicians thought that calculating certain formulas was a trade secret; a kind of alchemy best kept to oneself.

We share information, which helps us as a cooperative given even basic economic principles. Information is the "invisible hand" in competition that lets us compete fairly. A fair competition is a cooperative effort in the end because everyone has agreed to the rules.

Reported by \[moving to freedom (dot-org)\](http://movingtofreedom.org/2006/10/06/thomas-jefferson-on-patents-and-freedom-of-ideas/)Thomas Jefferson wrote to Isaac McPherson in 1813:

> If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.
