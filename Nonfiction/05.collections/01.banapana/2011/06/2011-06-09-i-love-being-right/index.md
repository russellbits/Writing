[Me in 2008](http://banapana.com/the-hivemind/a-hybrid-standard-for-software):

> "...this new view of the network as the computer is a binary view, problematic because as software engineers still tend to do, the solution takes the user into account second and not first. A user-first outlook for most software demands of it that it be a desktop-cloud hybrid—with good reason. And a desktop-cloud hybrid won’t suck the OS in the browser, it will suck the browser into all the apps that a user has.

[Steve Jobs via Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/apple-icloud-google-cloud/) in 2011:

> “You know, if the hardware is the brain and the sinew of our products, the software in them is their soul,” Jobs said on Monday. Apple is now more clearly than ever betting that will not be web software, but native software backed invisibly by the web. Google’s position is decidedly less clear. With the existence of Chrome OS and Android, they’re currently betting on both. That dichotomy screams anything but "it just works."

Nailed it.
