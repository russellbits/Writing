Woah. I don't often bother with movie reviews, but "\[Never Let Me Go\](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Never\_Let\_Me\_Go/70120827?trkid=2361637)" will affect the way you live your life. Part ethereal, part horrifying. Are you part of the machine or will you demand more? I won't do spoilers, but this is the best kiss you will see in a long time. This kiss tempers time and longing and finality. An amazing a plot line unfolds through the lives of humans who are ultimately limited. But aren't we all? It is an alternate history that begins in 1967. It is Orwellian in nature with buzzers and misplaced technology. It's a story of love unvanquished; it is ungrim given the climate created. It is also awful, the results of a wayward history. From the moment that the pastel colors are put on the screen, you will be transported to a world that never was; is horrible---and love survives it. It is not just science fiction of the past, it is a fairy tale the likes of which the Brothers Grimm could not have imagined. Watch this movie and then go to the closest park you can get to and watch the trees in the breeze.
