I found a new meme on Twitter (the coolest social app there is). With twitter, if you want to refer to a particular subject, you can put a # in front of the key word (the same way you can reply to someone by putting @ in front of their user name). Someone's started a #JTP subject which stands for "Just the Punchline." What's funny (sad?) is that I actually recognize quite a few of them.
