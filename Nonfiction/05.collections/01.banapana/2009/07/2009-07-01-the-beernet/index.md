In Jalalabad, Afghanistan there is a unique little tiki bar called the Taj (apparently the only bar for hundreds of miles) that has hit on a unique proposition for creating "social media software." Since the bar is the only one around, there is a unique mixture of individuals, from military personnel to consultants for NGOs to mercenaries.\[^1\] Any of the patrons are made the offer that if they will deposit some information that they have (photos, white papers, GPS coordinates) on the bar's terrabyte server, they can have a free beer, as well as download any information they want from the server. I'd call it a beernet!

You can hear more about it at length \[in this video interview\](http://blip.tv/file/1701435) of Smari McCarthy by Vinay Gupta. \[via the \[Humanitarian Technology Network\](http://humanitariantechnet.asu.edu)\]
