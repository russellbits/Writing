I've realized now that one cannot be moral; one must wait for the moment of morality and hope that you have practiced it such that it sweeps you up. Unprepared and moral makes a saint of anyone. Prepared and moral is the simple consequence of breaking the habit of being just human. To be cognizant as only we humans can is to know to be prepared. Then one can be moral.
