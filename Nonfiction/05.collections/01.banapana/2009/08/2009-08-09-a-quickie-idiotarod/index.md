Hopefully more to come today, since I've been away from my blog for a week and a half in Amsterdam, but first just a quick note on a new word that I found and love: Idiotarod. Not exactly sure how I would pronounce this, but clearly some cue should be taken from the original Iditarod---the \[world's most famous sled-dog race\](http://www.iditarod.com/). Instead, Idiotarod brings to mind the thousands of commuter vehicles, sit idly in their slowly moving lanes every weekday. \[Thanks to Vica of \[La Vida Vica\](http://lavidavica.blogspot.com/2008/08/id-hit-that-in-which-i-discover-that-i.html) for coining such a great word!\]
