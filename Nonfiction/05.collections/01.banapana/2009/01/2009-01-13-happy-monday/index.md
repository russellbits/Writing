Not a lot to post here today since I'm working on a big project to post in the next few days. But, if while you're waiting you'd like to make your ears bleed, you should check out \[this awesome mashup\](http://music.metafilter.com/2943/Runnin-With-The-Songsmith) of David Lee Roth and the new \[Microsoft Songsmith\](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=3oGFogwcx-E)!--Everyone's got a song inside! Really, Microsoft? Just stop it.

I don't think this little ditty has top=notch meme high-fidelity, but I would put even money on it showing up on \[ytmnd\](http://ytmnd.com) in a few weeks.
