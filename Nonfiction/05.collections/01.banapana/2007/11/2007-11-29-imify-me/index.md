Just found a program called \[IMified\](http://www.imified.com). It's really handy due to its widget structure---allowing you to basically pipe web site APIs into ichat---so close to the concept I had in mind when I wrote about the \[LUI\](http://www.banapana.com/airobotics/the-lui-language-user-interface). Well, it's definitely a good step in the right direction; it's even got me using aim regularly again. ((For those of you who never got into the AIM thing, you might want to check out \[Sandy\](http://www.iwantsandy.com), an online assistant who helps you with tasks through email.))
