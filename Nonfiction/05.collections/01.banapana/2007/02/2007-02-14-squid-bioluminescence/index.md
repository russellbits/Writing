Squids and Cephalopods have eyes that are much more advanced than human eyes. This is due in part to the fact that their optical nerves do not travel through the lense to the brain, as they do in primates. Thus they likely have a much finer resolution. They can also detect polarized light. We can't. All this goes to support the ironic Intelligent Design argument that God likes squids better than us. (I forget where I originally read this argument. If you can think of or know of the source, let me know, so I can properly attribute it here.) Now, \[this article\](http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/giant-squid-dazzles-prey-with-fireworks/) on Squid Bioluminescence gives \*yet another\* compelling reason why God prefers squids to us. We had to event TV. \\\[Update - 07.03.01 - Squids can also grow to be \[much, much larger\](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6385071.stm) than humans.\\\]
