George Scialabba at \[Boston.com\](http://www.boston.com) wrote up \[an interesting comparison\](http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2007/02/25/contemplate\_this\_ai\_vs\_meditation/) between Marvin Minsky's new book, [The Emotion Machine](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEmotion-Machine-Commonsense-Artificial-Intelligence%2Fdp%2F0743276639%2F&tag=wwwrussellwar-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwrussellwar-20&l=ur2&o=1) and B. Alan Wallace's new tome [Contemplative Science](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FContemplative-Science-Buddhism-Neuroscience-Converge%2F&tag=wwwrussellwar-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwrussellwar-20&l=ur2&o=1). I'm not sure I see the value in the comparison. In the general field of cognitive science (and in a very broad interpretation that would include AI and neuorscience), I don't think Minsky and Wallace could be farther apart. But the comparison did make me think of one of my favorite sentences in literature written by one Philip K. Dick in [Paycheck and Other Classic Stories](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPaycheck-Other-Classic-Stories-Philip%2Fdp%2F0806526300%2F&tag=wwwrussellwar-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwrussellwar-20&l=ur2&o=1), "It meditated."
