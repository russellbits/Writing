Mostly due to the work that is going on over at \[Troped\](http://www.troped.com), an ongoing hypernovel, I have found the need to attempt to develop a new XML standard for fiction. I've written everything I can think of regarding what a standard markup language for fiction should try to accomplish, look like, function as, etc. over on this \[page\](http://www.banapana.com/fiction-markup-language/). A Google Group is being thrown together as well as a Wikipedia page. There is a new way for us to deal with stories, one that is much more maleable then what we currently have. A user should be able to re-arrange a story, list the characters involved, see the chronology of the story, cross-reference where two characters appear together and much, much more. I explain most of the motivations over at the \[FicML home page\](http://www.banapana.com/fiction-markup-language/).
