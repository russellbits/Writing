I knew it! A \[new study\](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17279961/) shows that people have a harder time generating solutions to problems when they are engaged in the exercise as a group. And since there is some science loosely tied in to this post, now I am just going to rant about the time I was in a meeting and my boss, exasperated with a project that was growing out of hand used this \[gem of a mixed metaphor\](http://www.stuntmonkey.com/metaphor/), "We have to water down this speeding bullet." Sigh. \[Those were the days\](http://www.fuckedcompany.com/). Most meetings I've participated in seemed like little more than exercises in \[blamestorming\](http://www.unwords.com/unword/blamestorming.html), or babysitting. "Have you done thing X that I asked you to do?" "Yes." "Then here's thing Y." OR "Have you done thing X that I asked you to do?" "No." "Why?" "Because of thing Z." This is all a gross generalization but who cares. Even people who \[like meetings, don't think they're useful\](http://www.unwords.com/unword/blamestorming.html).
