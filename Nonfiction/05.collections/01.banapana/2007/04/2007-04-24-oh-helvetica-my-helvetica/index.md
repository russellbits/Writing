Ah, Helvetica. How I love the labor you effortlessly accomplish; the simple visual communitcation you convey without \[flourish or pretension\](http://www.apple.com/). I love your proportions and your apparent lack of cultural bias. I love your \[worldliness\](http://www.un.org/aroundworld/unics/)--even when they _desecrate_ you with drop shadows.

But oh, Helvetica, how I hate thee, Helvetica. How I despise your affair with global corporations who wish to twist your ability to neutrally clarify with their \[malopropisms\](http://www.pwc.com/) and \[meaningless drivel\](http://www.accenture.com) and \[bullshit\](http://www.bp.com). How I despise how you have come to stand for all their madness and become a symbol for all that is "serious." How I grown impatient with your \[conformity\](http://www.pentagram.com/). Helvetica, I think it's time you retired. But first, \[a biopic\](http://www.helveticafilm.com/).
