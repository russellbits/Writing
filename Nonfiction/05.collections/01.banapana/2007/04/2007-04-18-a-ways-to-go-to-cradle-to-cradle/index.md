The main point about Global Warming that needs to sink in (honestly even if you believe that it's merely a \[natural phenomenon\](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/06/010615071248.htm "And you're a kook if you do.")) is that the planet is a limited system with definite capacities to support us. By 2050 the Earth is going to have to support \[9.5 \*billion\* people\]\[id\]. This means doing more than just labeling things as "green" as several big box retailers \[are doing\](http://consumerist.com/consumer/home-depot/home-depot-to-introduce-green-labeling-252967.php). It means \[a lot more\](http://reclaimdemocracy.org/walmart/2007/stacy\_mitchell\_environment.php), because 9.5 billion people can't all hop in their SUVs and head down to Wal-mart and still have this whole ecosystem-thing work out well. We need to completely re-evaluate the way we go about doing everything. For instance, it's not just that the big box retailers are or are not hawking green goods; it's that their business model necessitates large locations that \[require shoppers to drive further\](http://www.planetizen.com/node/23447) to get to. That, in turn means massive parking lots that destroy valuable oxygen generating plant-spaces. Being sustainable is not just being green. It means that a company needs to examine how it can \[remodel its business so that nothing is wasted\](http://www.mcdonough.com/cradle\_to\_cradle.htm). Our failure to do it will be our undoing. But you know, it just occurred to me, with all that roof space, there's plenty of room for a damn big \[rooftop garden\](http://www.gardeners.com/Rooftop-Gardens/default/5283.page).
