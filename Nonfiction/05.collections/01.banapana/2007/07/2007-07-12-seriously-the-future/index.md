It doesn't seem to be showing up on my \[LibraryThing\](http://www.librarything.com) but the latest fiction book I've been reading is Vernor Vinge's [Rainbows End](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRainbows-End-Vernor-Vinge%2Fdp%2F0812536363%2F&tag=wwwrussellwar-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwrussellwar-20&l=ur2&o=1). And I have pretty much found myself stunned by its proclamations. As I've argued \[here\](http://www.banapana.com/media/interface-avant-garde-and-media), I think the final computer interface is one in which our virtual data is merely laid over the top of our world. And Vinge does a beautiful job of painting a picture as to what that world would look like and be like. In a lot of ways the book reminds me of how Brave New World made me feel. It's a somewhat Utopian vision that may not leave you feeling comfortable in the end.
