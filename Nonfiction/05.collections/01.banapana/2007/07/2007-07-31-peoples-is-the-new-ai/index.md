So, I guess in light of the fact that the modus operandi for AI for the last 25 years \[is defunct\](http://robots.net/article/157.html) we need another direction to head in. Of course there are your Jeff Hawkins who want to suggest \[pretty good theories for intelligence\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-prediction\_framework) but let's face it, he's totally \[not in the club\](http://www.sfn.org/). Despite what \[he's got to say\](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/125), I think it's high time we took a look at a really new way of generating intelligence---\[us\](http://www.physorg.com/news102243522.html)!
