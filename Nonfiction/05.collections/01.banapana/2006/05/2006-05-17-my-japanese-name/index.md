While musing over the name of a character (who is Japanese-American) in my upcoming novel, "The Hunger Engine" I found a web site that will [tell you your Japanese name](http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/toys/namegen/). Mine is:

> **猿渡 Saruwatari (monkey on a crossing bridge) 大輝 Taiki (large radiance)**

Awesome. I suppose it's not literal or anything, just random, but whatever. Anything having to do with monkeys rocks.
