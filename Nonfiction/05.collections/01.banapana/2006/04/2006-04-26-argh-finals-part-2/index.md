\[_UPDATE 4.26: Sorry for the broken link--it's been fiexed_ \] [This film clip](http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/04/woz_shootswoz_scores.html?CMP=OTC-13IV03560550&ATT=Woz+Shoots+Woz+Scores) over at O'reilly came to my attention. For those of you that don't know, Steve "the Woz" Wozniak is one of the two infamous co-founders of Apple computers. Unlike [the other one](http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html) he decided to use his money to hang out, [do good stuff](http://www.woz.org/education/index.html) and apparently start a new movement of [Cyberjocks](http://www.bayareaseg.com/Polo.htm). This just makes me wonder, can nerds really use technology to become jocks?
