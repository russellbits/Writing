As you may have guessed from the title I am in the middle of finals and posted nothing recently as a result. Nonetheless, today I bring you a tidbit from the world wide wilderness: [PingMag](http://www.pingmag.jp/) It's a nice little digital rag about making things. My favorite feature so far is [10 Tiny Tokyo Pictures](http://www.pingmag.jp/2006/03/07/10-tiny-tokyo-photos/) -- they use [high dynamic range photos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging) to make actual photos of Tokyo look like photos of models.
