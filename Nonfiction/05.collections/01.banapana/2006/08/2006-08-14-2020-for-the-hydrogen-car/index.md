I remember reading in Wired Magazine a few years back that GM had committed to turning the oil frigate-like bloated bulk of its corporate structure toward the future and the hydrogen economy. Yeah. I remember reading that, right? So I checked Google news today for "GM hydrogen" and there it was! GM has a [working, driving, prototype](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/10/tech/main1884392.shtml) of the Sequel. "Experts say they could begin arriving in showrooms by 2020." 2020!? Is this the best GM can do? Perhaps it's time that they consider spinning off the Autonomy project as a separate company entirely so that they can actually get a product on the market before the rest of us [drown](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0420_040420_earthday.html).
