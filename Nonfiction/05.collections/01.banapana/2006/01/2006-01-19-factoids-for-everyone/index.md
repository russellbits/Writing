Today I would just like to share with you this fascinating [collection of factoids](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/cyc/index.htm) brought to you by [Susan Stepney](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/index.htm) of the University of York. It truly astounds me when people do this sort of thing -- collect facts of their own interest and share them with people. Who knows. I'm just feeling sentimental today. And so on that note, I tell you this: Factoid was coined in 1973 by [Norman Mailer](http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/nmailer.htm). He says, "Factoids ... that is, facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper, creations which are not so much lies as a product to manipulate emotion in the Silent Majority." \[Thanks, [guys](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=factoid&searchmode=none)\]
