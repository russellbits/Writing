\[Reverend Billy\](http://www.revbilly.com/) (a.k.a. Bill Talen) and his wife Savitri D. organize protests (they call actions) that attempt to create a "radical instability" in the hopes that they will punch a hole in the matrix-like reality that is the average consumers' existence. In \[an interesting interview\](http://www.realitysandwich.com/video/beyond\_shopocalypse\_part\_one) over at \[Reality Sandwich\](http://www.realitysandwich.com/), Jonathan Talat Philips, director of \[Evolver.net\](http://www.evolver.net) asks some pertinent questions of the anti-consumption duo. You'll even find \[some handy tips for yourself about getting off the grid\](http://www.evolver.net/node/48444).
