As a blog concerned with the effect of the media on the mind, it's hard not to be concerned with the effects of fame on the populace and the individuals that enjoy fame. My niece is currently loving Calvin and Hobbes which caused me to look into Bill Watterson, the author. In a question and answer session, upon the release of his "[Complete Calvin and Hobbes (Amazon link)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0740748475?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwrussellwar-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0740748475)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwrussellwar-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0740748475)" publication, readers posted questions to him and \[he answered\](http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/interview.html). The pragmatic nature of the answer to this reader's question impresses me.

I wish reclusiveness would become a useful marketing strategy. To not have to hear the Famous pine would be a silence we've not known in generations. I don't think we'd recognize the peace for what it was.
