I've been using \[the sixty one\](http://www.thesixtyone) for a bit and I have to say this site is clearly what music has been needing as a replacement for radio for the internet. Or, probably, this is what a music junkie like me needs. \[Pandora\](http://pandora.com) serves for passive listening for a lot people I would guess, but for folks like me who spend a lot of time digging around on iTunes and looking up the names of songs I heard on TV or in movies, this site is ideal. It basically turns finding new music into a video game. You can gain reputation points for completing "quests." The more quests you get, the better your reputation. You share and download as well. I especially intend to let my friends in bands know about this. It'll be a great way to get fans.
