That's right, I said it: brain-computer interface.  It's coming soon to a computer near you and Hrafn Thorisson (fellow \[twiner\](http://www.twine.com)) has \[the scoop\](http://www.thinkartificial.org/machine-interfaces/first-consumer-brain-machine-interface/) over at his blog \[thinkartificial.org\](http://www.thinkartificial.org/).  The device is essentially an electroencephalogram (EEG) which detects brain activity via nodes placed on (or in this case, near) the scalp.  But unlike predecessors that, at best, could detect brain pattern waves, this device seems to have achieved better resolution and can interpret more complex commands.  I'll be very interested to see how something like this might work in concert with predictive typing.
