Via \[Cognews\](http://www.cognews.com) I found "\[Robot Consumers, Grow Up!\](http://www.pcmag.com)" by Lance Ulanoff. His basic premise is that the more that robots look like real humans or animals, the more put off the American consumer is by it. But I couldn't disagree more with this analysis, and there's a very different way of looking at it. American consumers are some of the most risk-taking consumers in the world. A simple fact of the American economy is that we like new things---a great deal of our economic growth depends on this. However, we do demand of our products that they prove actually useful (or wildly entertaining). \[$350 toys\](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2148844,00.asp), regardless of their complexity (or how much they look like dinosaurs) don't interest us as much as a robot that can actually vacuum the floor. From my personal point of view, an AIBO gets less bang for buck compared to a wind-up toy. And I'm not underestimating it's complexity, as Ulanoff would argue---that the Aibo is complex is a given. But complexity for the sake of what? What does it do that a virtually free dog from the animal shelter doesn't?

Who cares what it looks like as long as it can do the job? American consumers aren't put off by humanoid robots; the problem with \*all\* humanoid robots is that they are little more than very \[expensive toys\](http://www.wowwee.com/robosapien/robo1/robomain.html) at this point. The humanoid form-factor is really only useful if you're smart enough to use it (which doesn't necessarily imply human-level intelligence--just a lot). Until such a time, useful robots will remain \[tanks\](http://www.defensereview.com/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=657) and \[frisbees\](http://www.irobot.com) and all the better because they can actually do labor that way (instead of \[falling down the stairs\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASoCJTYgYB0)).
