I've been a designer for more than a decade and I only scored a 24 out of 34 on on the \[Rather Difficult Font Game\](http://ajax.sayitaintslow.com/fontgame/).  In my defense, I don't stray too much from the 14 or so fonts that I really like (Hoefler Text, Helvetica, Trebuchet, Monaco, Gotham, Archer, Academy, Bauhaus, Futura, Eurostile, Impact, Optima, Rollergirls, Rosewood STD, and Lucinda)  And only four of those were in the quiz!  So Phbbbbt!\[^1\]

\[^1\]: \*Update\*: And Krungthep! I forgot Krungthep.
