With all the \[hubbub\](http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN0932653120080910) about McCain and Obama being in a "dead heat" in the polls, I'm still wondering about the accuracy of these polls in the first place. Pollsters don't call mobile phones, they call landlines. What demographic in this country do you suppose is \[less likely to have a landline and own only a mobile\](http://news.digitaltrends.com/news-article/16281/one-in-five-u-s-adults-has-no-landline)? And which demographic is \[really excited about Obama\](http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1700525,00.html)? Give the significant differences between \[the prediction markets\](http://iemweb.biz.uiowa.edu/graphs/graph\_Pres08\_WTA.cfm) (still almost ten points) and the polls, I seriously have to wonder if the pollsters are underestimating their tactics. I don't think McCain is doing nearly as well as the media thinks he is.
