I love Jean Baudrillard though I often don't agree with him. Still though, cynical though this quote may be, and given the current spirit of the election---a holyier-than-thou multiple personality clash rather than an intelligent debate---I wonder if he's not right.

"In the same way that we need statesmen to spare us the abjection of exercising power, we need scholars to spare us the abjection of learning."

\---\[Jean Baudillard\](http://thinkexist.com/quotes/jean\_baudrillard/)
