At one time or another I have thought to myself "It might be fun to try boxing." No more! Even thought the opportunity never really presented itself, if it did now I would not be interested. Why, you ask? This \[little piece of footage\](http://edge.famecast.com/actionfigure//AQ\_PUNCHES\_EDIT.mov) pretty clearly illustrates (at 1000 frames per second) that when you are punched in the face, your skull moves faster that all the tissue and skin on it. And if you like the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure the band is \[kapOw\](http://www.myspace.com/kapowmusic) from out of Brooklyn (whom I like) but I'll update when I know for sure.
