A blog appears on the internet, written by a man named HÃ¥kan Nordkvist who claims to have traveled to the future and that he has proof. Later, a \[video surfaces\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yuhr6nUH31k). Apparently, this man crawled under his sink and into the future where he met himself and took a mobile phone video of the event. The video is viewed thousands of times and debated by many. The problem? The entire matter was conceived by \[AMF Pensions\](http://www.amfpension.se/templates/Page.aspx?id=3672) to market to a "younger" generation. \[This video\](http://demo.fb.se/e/amf/timetraveller/) is part of a portfolio of "guerrilla" marketing campaigns propagated by \[Forsman & Bodenfors\](http://demo.fb.se). The apparent logic of the marketing campaign is that you should give your money to people who are willing to deceive and lie to you for a good laugh. The problem with this sort of campaign is that not everyone finds out that the matter is a hoax; more disinformation is created in an already incredibly noisy environment. This kind of marketing is simply unethical and is the worst kind of propaganda because it is in no way concerned with the truth or even willing to make a case, based on evidence, for the value of the product. It's \[bullshit\](http://www.shelfari.com/books/27720/On-Bullshit) is what it is.
