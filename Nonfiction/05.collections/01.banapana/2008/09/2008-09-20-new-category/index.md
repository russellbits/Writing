This last week I have seen some pretty strange things going on with advertising, and even though I generally put posts on advertising into the Mind Control section of the sight (because it is all just propaganda) it seems to me that it would be a good idea to introduce a new section: Fabertising.  That's Fab- as in fabrication and -ertising as in you know, "shoving bullshit down your throat."  I would love to call the section bullshitising, but the icon for that would be grisly.  I think there's enough manipulation of the facts in commercially developed communications directed at the public that focusing on it should generate more than a few worthy posts.  I'm also going to put summations of research here on how exactly advertising manipulates you into bad choices.
