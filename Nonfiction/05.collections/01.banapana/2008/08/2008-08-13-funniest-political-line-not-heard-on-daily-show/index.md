> "I don't believe Condoleezza Rice can actually play piano. Everything else she's ever touched has been a fraud and a catastrophe, why should her alleged musical abilities be any different? Think about it. Think about any event she's been even remotely involved in since you first heard her name. An endless string of threats and blundering and arrogant bluffs turned squalid pigf\*cks. It's not that she can't do her job; she can't do anything. I think when she plays piano the piano catches fire and the audience dies."

That last sentence really got me. Mind you, I'm not entirely in agreement here. It was Secretary Rice's State Department individuals who investigated the actions of commanders on the ground in order to find the "build and hold" strategy that Petraeus was able to utilize force-wide. Granted, the war had been thoroughly screwed up at that point, but it is one of the elements that has helped to make Iraq less of a disaster. Credit where credit is due. However, that last sentence still really gets me.
