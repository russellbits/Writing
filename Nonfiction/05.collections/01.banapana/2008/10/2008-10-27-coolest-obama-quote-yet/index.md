It's a quote like this, from Obama's \[interview with Rolling Stone\](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/23589412/) that reminds me how smart he is. It's one thing to see him being spirited and stoic in front of a crowd of thousands, but it's another thing to see this side of him; the deft and strategic thinker.

> **In what way will people underestimate you as president?** \[Long pause\] Because I tend to be a pretty courteous person and I don't lose my temper, I think people underestimate my willingness to mix it up. I don't know if they'll continue to underestimate that after this campaign, but I think you'll still get columns saying, "He's too cool, he's too soft." \[Laughs\] That's OK, actually.
> 
> **You like being underestimated in that way.** Yeah. No point in having them see you coming.

I don't think McCain subscribes to that point of view.
