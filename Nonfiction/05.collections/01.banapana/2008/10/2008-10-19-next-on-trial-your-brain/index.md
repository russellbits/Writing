Ran into \[this story\](http://io9.com/5065285/the-next-witness-for-the-prosecution-could-be-your-brain) regarding using brain scans in court as evidence against criminals via \[io9\](http://io9.com/). SFgate has a bit more \[on the story\](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/16/MN8M13AC0N.DTL&tsp=1) and the general consensus is that techniques such as fMRI and new lie detection will be admissible in court within the next five years. What I don't understand is why in neither of these articles is the 5th amendment to the Constitution even mentioned. For a fun civil rights lesson, let's review it.

> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

Did you notice that little part there about "nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." Can someone explain to me how a picture of your brain---namely, you---can be used as evidence against you and not be considered self-incrimination? The science is sketchy at nest at this point, but that it violates people's 5th amendment rights is beyond the pale.
