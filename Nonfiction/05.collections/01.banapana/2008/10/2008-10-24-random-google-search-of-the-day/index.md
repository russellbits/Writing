I was testing out \[Inquisitor in Safari\](http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/index\_en.php) (which I \*highly\* recommend and which now available for Firefox and IE---you'll never go back to regular seaches.) and I started out by typing a boring "Hello". The results were boring: \[Hello Magazine\](http://www.hellomagazine.com/) at the top. Then I followed it with "kitty" (it's my subconscious, don't ask) and the updated results were not particularly interesting either, so I got a little intense and typed "inquisition." It was probably primed in my memory from thinking about Inquisitor, but you gotta admit, "Hello kitty inquisition" is a pretty good search term. The result you ask? The \[Warhammer 40K, Hello Kitty Sisters of Battle brigade\](http://www.exlibrismortis.org/ExLibrisnewSistersArmy.html). If you never played big tabletop games as a kid, you may not want to know, but for those of us who were into the miniatures, this is downright hilarious. I would just love to see some ubergeek pwned by the Sisters of Battle. Pink tanks... oo-rah!
