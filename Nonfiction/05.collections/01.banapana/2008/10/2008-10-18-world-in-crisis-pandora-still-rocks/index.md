With all the bad news lately, I decided it was time to put together an upbeat punk-pop-rock station on \[Pandora\](http://www.pandora.com) so at least \*something\* sounded kind of happy, if not peppy-mad. The thing is, I could think of a few bands I wanted to seed this one with, among them, \[The Ting Tings\](http://www.myspace.com/thetingtings) and \[Metric\](http://www.myspace.com/metricband)---both good at being mad with an upbeat sound; rebels all. But there was this other band... swedish, I think. I hadn't listened to them in years and just couldn't think of the name, even though I knew it was really simple. Well, three songs into listening to my new station who comes up but \[the Sounds\](http://www.myspace.com/thesounds)! Wow. The very band I couldn't recall. Pandora borders on psychic when it does stuff like this. By far the best music web site out there, folks. \[Tune into my new station\](http://www.pandora.com/stations/7f87a543b69d4af4ba73d19387cd3c75c874869f84047ca8) and check it out for yourself!
