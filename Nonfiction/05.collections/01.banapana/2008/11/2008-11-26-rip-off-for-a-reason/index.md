Amazing. The Republican'ts lose, big-time, and the best they can do?---rip-off Barack Obama's web site and call it "our newest grassroots Web site." I'm sorry, what was the one before this one? From the gradients, to the reflective surfaces, to the placement of social networking tools, to the tone, this things is a serious rip-off of all things \[Obama.com\](http://obama.com). I shouldn't even link to this \[sham of originality\](http://www.republicanforareason.com).
