Stop all the downloadin'! Okay, sorry for the \[Fensler Joe reference\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eA3XCvrK90)---it's been on my mind lately. But it may not be long before you need to look out for being conned by a machine. Aside from some strange footage of a CGI person, \[this article\](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2008/10/how\_to\_make\_an\_effective\_compu.php) over at Cognitive Daily discusses research that shows how people can be fooled by machines. The most effective method?---when the machine simply imitates a human.
