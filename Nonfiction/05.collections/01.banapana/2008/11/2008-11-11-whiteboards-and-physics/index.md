While this little piece is not quite as elegant as \[crayon physics\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsTqspnvAaI) or quite as realistic and detailed as \[MIT's illustration\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZNTgglPbUA) of whiteboard physics, \[this demonstration\](http://zoomdoggle.com/2008/11/whiteboard-pong/) of whiteboard pong is definitely a new take on the concept and one that would easily indicate to me the possibilities of what happens when some video game company figures out how to get tactile media video games into the home.
