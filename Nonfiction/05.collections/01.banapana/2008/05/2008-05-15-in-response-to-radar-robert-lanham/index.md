I could really take a hatchet to this utter whinefest, this gooey-mass-of-over-generalizations of \[an editorial\](http://www.radaronline.com/features/2008/05/generation\_x\_millennials\_facebook\_kevin\_colvin\_baby\_boomers.php) by \[Robert Lanham\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert\_Lanham). But I'm just going to say one thing in response to his statement that \[the Millenials\](http://www.buzzfeed.com/scott/the-war-on-millenials), "\[are\] always doing stupid shit, but rarely getting called on it."

Are you ready, Mr. Lanham? Good. George W. Bush. 'Nuff said.
