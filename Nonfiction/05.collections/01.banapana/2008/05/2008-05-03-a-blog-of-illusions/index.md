Arthur Shapiro, the man behind the \[Constrast Asynchrony Illusion\](http://shapirolab.net/) has announced that he has a backlog of thousands of optical illusions and is intending to regularly post them to \[his blog\](http://www.illusionsciences.com/). Great, now I can get dizzy sitting at the computer at least once a week!
