From Buenos Aries and Baden and the obviously bent mind of \[Blu\](blublu.org) comes this beautiful animation called "\[Muto\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuGaqLT-gO4)".  But don't suppose this is just any animation, this is a motion piece done on public walls over what must have been a period of weeks or years.  The soundtrack, created by \[Andrea Martignoni\](http://beemp3.com/download.php?file=1001686&song=Nota+bene+VI) \[^1\], is appropriately strange and stilted.  The lack of standing camera work on the animation gives it a very unsettling life, like watching time-lapse footage of slow-moving living artwork.  This is one of the most creative ideas I've seen on the internet in months.

\[^1:\] I'm not clear yet at to whether this obscure mp3 link is the same Andrea Martignoni, but the sound is similar.  I'm looking into it.
