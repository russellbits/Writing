Despite the fact that "Semantic Web" has been \[trending down\](http://google.com/trends?q=semantic+web) (at least in Google searches), it seems like more web sites devoted to it are popping up these days. I've been messing around with \[Twine\](http://www.twine.com) for a fews weeks now and it seems pretty useful, although it definitely can't accomplish what they claim. \[^1\] A new one that I stumbled into, via \[KurzweilAI.net\](http://www.kurzweilai.net/) is \[Powerset\](http://www.powerset.com). My 30 second review is that I tried searches on two pretty obscure subjects that I've been reading about lately, the St. Petersburg factor\[^2\] and \[kriegsspiel\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegsspiel). Basically, I got the same search results at wikipedia, powerset and google---no immediately discernible differences.

A few nice things do stand out about Powerset. The ajaxy integration of content into the search results page is definitely a step up from Google's fairly wimpy page snippets. This feature alone would make it much easier to peruse results for accuracy and usefulness.\[^3\] I'm also impressed with the fact that Powerset appears to be gathering data from \[Freebase\](http://www.freebase.com)---an important open source database of information that's a fundamental step towards creating a semantic web.

But if you ask Google and Powerset the question, "What is math?" you get pretty different answers. Google says: > a science (or group of related sciences) dealing with the logic of quantity and > shape and arrangement

Powerset says: > MATH is an American Improv/experimental band formed in Woodstock, New York in the mid 90s.

While this may be true, I don't think it wins the semantic claims any points. True enough, if you ask "What is mathematics?" you get a better answer. But shouldn't a search engine claiming semantic abilities understand synonyms? Apparently, not yet. But I'll definitely keep using Powerset and report back as I understand more.

\[^1\]: In short, they claim that it can be a replacement for Del.icio.us and your blog and most things social. They don't apparently understand some important rules about personalization in this regard.

\[^2\]: Weirdly, no one, including Google, had any information about this, which seriously makes me question its existence, since I've only seen one reference in a book so far! I'll definitely have to post about it later.

\[^3\]: This reminds me, I \*really\* wish someone would create a feature that would allow you to eliminate search results from repeated searches. Like, let me save a search and then slowly cull it down to what I think are the relevant results. The data from those individuals who did the culling would surely be useful to the search engines.
