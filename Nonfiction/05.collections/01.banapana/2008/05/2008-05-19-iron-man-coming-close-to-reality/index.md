I feel like I should maybe add a category to this blog, like "Things That Used to be Fiction," but this article over at \[Physorg\](http://www.physorg.com/) illustrates \[just how close\](http://physorg.com/news130078697.html) we currently are to the \[summer's biggest blockbuster\](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/iron\_man/) so far.
