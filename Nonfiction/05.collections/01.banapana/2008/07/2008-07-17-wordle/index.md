I think, by now, anyone who's digerati has seen Wordle. \[Wired\](http://www.wired.com) made a big thing of it a few days ago, \[visualizing several word clouds\](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/07/thoughts-on-iph.html) revolving around the new iphone. I also just saw a \[great cloud\](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/07/bernanke-word-c.html) over at \[The Big Picture\](http://bigpicture.typepad.com) constructed from \[Ben Bernanke's\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernanke) presentation to Congressâ€”a great use of Wordle. So I'm just throwing my two cents in, too.

Here's a cloud constructed from all the tags used here at Banapana:

Here's just a cloud of the front page of Banapana:

At least with the tag cloud, I'm glad to see that media is the largest word, since that's what this blog purports to be about!
