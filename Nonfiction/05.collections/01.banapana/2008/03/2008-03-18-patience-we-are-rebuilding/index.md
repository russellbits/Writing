I found a fairly significant advancement in the development of CSS over at \[Blueprint CSS\](http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/) on \[Google Code\](http://code.google.com/). The major benefit here would be the standardization of this site's XHTML and CSS, as well as the ability to "widgetize" the theme--something I've not been able to pull off before because of the CSS layout. It's exciting and I'm happy to be doing it, but I'm also too lazy to do it somewhere in a development environment and then move it here. I'm just going to do it here. It shouldn't take more than a few days anyway. In the meantime, some strangeness may happen, but that's okay. Let's just call it avant-garde design--kay?
