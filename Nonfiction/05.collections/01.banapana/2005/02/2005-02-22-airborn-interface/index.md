Since interface has been the topic du jour several times this week I thought I would point to a particular interface that I found the other day at [NAO design](http://www.naodesign.net/). These guys do some really awesome stuff, but their telefloatation device is really something. Essentially a virtual reality helmet linked up to a blimp, it gives the user the ability to look down on an area and observe. Like I said, [neat stuff](http://www.futurehi.net/archives/000561.html).
