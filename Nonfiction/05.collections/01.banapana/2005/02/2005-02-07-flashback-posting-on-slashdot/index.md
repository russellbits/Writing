\[_This is actually an old post I made to [Slashot.org](http://slashdot.org) about a year ago. I haven't seen this implemented anywhere yet but the concept is still very interesting to me so I'm posting it here to revitalize the idea._\]

Julian Bleecker's web site [TechKwonDo](http://www.techkwondo.com/) describes a [project](http://www.techkwondo.com/projects/bedouin/index.html) that is a wifi base station in a backpack. 'WiFi.Bedouin is a wearable, mobile 802.11b node disconnected from the global Internet. It forms a WiFi "island Internet" challenging conventional assumptions about WiFi and suggesting new architectures for digital networks that are based on physical proximity rather than solely connectivity.' The motivation is essentially subversive but what other uses are there for a device like this?
