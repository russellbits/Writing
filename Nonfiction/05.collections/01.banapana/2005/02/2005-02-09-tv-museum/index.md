With all the talk of TV making a transition to the Internet it's nice to find a site like the [TV ARK](http://www.tv-ark.org.uk/), a site that documents a number of television station identification and promos. One of my favorite identifications (and sound samples) has always been the WBGH identification. It always came on after Nova -- a staple program in my family's viewing habits. It's odd that the [Monty Python's Flying Circus](http://www.pythonline.com/) is not present amongst the comedy shows.
