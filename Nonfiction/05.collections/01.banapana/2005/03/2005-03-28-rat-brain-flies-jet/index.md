Uh. Seriously. They took neurons from a rat brain, suspended it in some crazy liquid and hooked it up and got it [flying an F-22 simulation](http://www.theregister.com/2004/12/07/rat_brain_flies_jet/). Bizarre. The odd thing is that I [recently completed](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/03/on_intelligence_1.html) reading Jeff Hawkins' "On Intelligence" where he points out that neural network (or connectivist) approaches to machine intelligence haven't come too far in too long. I guess there's no accounting for the time lag in paper publishing.
