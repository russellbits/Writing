Well, this [little meme](http://www.deadprogrammer.com/?p=1620) seems to be popping its head up everywhere: Omnium Finis Imminent. So far it's been [speculated](Omnium Finis Imminent) that this is some kind of alternate reality game similar to [Ilovebees](http://www.ilovebees.com). I decided to [participate](http://www.monkeytroniccircusofconquest.com/slogan.html) just for fun. \[_04-05-2005 Update: This didn't turn out to be much of a culturejam after all. It was just advertising for the TV show Revelations. Phooey._\]
