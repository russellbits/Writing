It's odd because even though I read about culture jamming all the time, I haven't really found anything that motivated me to make an entry about it on the blog. So, rather than wait for someone else to do something in regards to it, I made my own [contribution](http://www.monkeytroniccircusofconquest.com/advertisement4.html). Enjoy. And write me if you want a hi-res version for any reason. The whole thing is a big [CC](http://creativecommons.org/) effort anyway.
