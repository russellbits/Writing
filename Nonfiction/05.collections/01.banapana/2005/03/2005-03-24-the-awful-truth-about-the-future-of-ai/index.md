I found this on Slashdot [regarding an article](http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/05/03/24/1518224.shtml?tid=126&tid=216) about Jeff Hawkins founding a new AI company called [Numenta](http://www.numenta.com/). It was posted by [Shadow Wrought](http://slashdot.org/~Shadow%20Wrought) and was too funny, so I thought I'd post it here:

> HAL: Dave, do I need a penis enlargement?  
> Dave: For the millionth time HAL, no. You don't have one, remember?  
> HAL: But if I did, do you think I would get better functionality if I used Viatroxx?  
> Dave: No. Now Hal...  
> HAL: Dave, it looks like there's another poor Nigerian who needs my help.  
> Dave: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggg!  
> HAL: Dave? What are you doing Dave?
