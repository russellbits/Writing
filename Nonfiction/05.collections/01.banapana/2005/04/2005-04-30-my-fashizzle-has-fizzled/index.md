I'm not sure that Snoop Dog's Fashizzle "dialect" or maybe rap latin (that's a fun term!) could necessarily be considered a meme. Maybe it's a group. But as meme's go, Ben Rayner at the Toronto Star is [ready to toll the trend's dizzle knell](http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/100/shiznit.htm). Frankly, I could listen to Snoop do it all day and it would never phase me. I'm in agreement with Rayner that it gets stupid when somebody at Fortune magazine does it.
