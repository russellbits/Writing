The memory-prediction framework that Jeff Hawkins proposes for the human mind in "[On Intilligence](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/03/on_intelligence_1.html)" claims that human minds would have difficulty comprehending things that break from patterns that we've come to recognize in the real world. We can adjust of course, but it takes time. So maybe that's why no matter how long I stare at [this thing](http://www.bewitched.com/m/models/depth.html) I can't seem to visually predict what's going to happen. Consciously, I can identify a new pattern but visually my eyes just "don't get it".
