Kathy Sierra [noticed that](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/04/difference_betw.html) the manholes in Japan were prettier than the ones she saw in her own neighborhood. She came to this conclusion: "We all need to start thinking more like designers and we all need to add meaning and significance to the things we create from software applications to learning experiences to books." She ain't just whistling Dixie. Your products, your things, your bosses' powerpoint presentation all affect your mood. Is it not odd that we as a society have placed so much emphasis on health and simultaneously, the value of our property, but have not reached the conclusion that maybe our possessions could be improved? I find it very odd and I'm with Kathy -- you should care about what you release into the world -- no matter what it is.
