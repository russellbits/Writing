Holy cow. A week. No posts. Terrible. Unfortunately, my studio (which shall remain nameless) has had a great week with three pitches to major companies. For the first time, as a matter of fact, I'm feel like I'm doing good work for good companies (as opposed to good work for companies whose motives I question). THREE pitches. That meant a few very late nights and working through the weekend. But don't worry. I have good stuff in store for you this week. More memes! More mind! more media! In the meantime, keep yourself busy with [this](http://www.monkeytroniccircusofconquest.com/FBF-exp.html).
