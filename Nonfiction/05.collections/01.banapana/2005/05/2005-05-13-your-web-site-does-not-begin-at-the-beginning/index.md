Now and then google points me to a page of this kind and I am forced to grumble to myself having come so close to information I was seeking only to be barred from it by an unthoughtful web designer. Type "mountain dew ad agency" into google (as in: who is Mountain Dew's Ad Agency) and you will receive [this link](http://advertising.about.com/library/quiz/blz6q4d.htm). The first thing you'll note is that this page is a mess with hardly any central focus. The second thing you will see is that this is the answer to Question #4. The question isn't on the page and there's no way to get back to it -- not even by tinkering with the nonsensical URL. The point here is: people end up on your web site from all sorts of trajectories and you have no way of knowing this. Most small businesses I've found tend to leave \*crucial\* information off their home page; a phone number and hours of operation. No one should have to click a link to get that basic information! Each and every page on a web site needs to be oriented and properly linked to related pages. This is BASIC. Read a [usability](http://www.useit.com) site please.
