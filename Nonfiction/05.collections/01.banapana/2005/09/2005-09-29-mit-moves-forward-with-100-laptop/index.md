[Nicholas Negroponte](http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/) is moving forward with his plans to unveil a sub $100 laptop to provide to children around the world. I [posted](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/04/video_games_for.html) on this a while ago on Banapana but despite my suggestion, it's great to see them moving forward with this project and creating what looks like a really [innovative laptop](http://beta.news.com.com/The+100+laptop+moves+closer+to+reality/2100-1044_3-5884683.html).
