Cognitive Science and Design - TOC

The Cognitive Science of Design -> A Medium web site waiting for a book deal!

This is kind of a repository of the "Best of Banapana"‚Äîso, Banapana should still exist; maybe on Medium üßê maybe not. But these essays should exist in a space that is mine. People are so stupid to turn themselves (and their art) over to turnkey solutions. I'm not going to do it!

(Take a closer look at "Design Literacy" and the length of the essays)

## Paula Scheer (quadrants of clients dumb-smart, excited-unexcited) and the Dunninger-Kruger Effect.

## Glassholes, Symmetry and Facial Indication ‚Äî ALREADY DONE! Needs a little work.

## When 'Wrong' Does Not Apply‚ÄîDONE!

## Fractacality in Art

## Information Visualizations for consumers (think Phylos)

## A Longitudinal Study of Web Design
From organic design to video game imitation to Roger Black and beyond.
What did we get right? What did we get wrong?

## If an image is not working, Blur it
when communicating messages, it can help a design to eliminate (or suss out) high frequency noise. It also activates the M1 portion of the brain which detects motion. (see Calvin and Hobbes example---speed lines assist in identifying motion) Do we see speed lines though?
Note the example of Marilyn Monroe/Einstein--- that is frequency at work---what does that mean for blurring images?

## Why do functional circles in UI still exist?

## Attentional Hierarchy

## the color red in fast food logos; is a trend or coincidence or is there science behind it?

## Modular scales and why we harmonize with them

A modular scale such as a golden ratio (1:1.618) creates visuals layouts that appear to be pleasant to the mind, but why? Is it perhaps the fact that we naturally learn to count this way?

## Dark apps and web sites are easier on the eyes
How does light work in the two different mediums. Note that in film, the credits are white one black.



## Monet and ray-tracing - his ocular degeneration shows that he was still painting the light.

## Word Recognition and Caps
X-heights and descenders; why the eye can really use these cues.

## Negative Space communicates
Edward Tufte
When Does 1+1=3?

## Spacing affects Symbolic, not just Perceptual processing
Equation spacing paper, see Dr. Robert Goldstone, Landy 2007 (visio-spatial influence on abstract)

## The nature of Helvetica; A science of fonts
Does Helvetica fill in the spaces of letter shapes ideally with regard to the "filling in" nature of the eye?

## Advertising: So you want to brainwash your client's customers?
See literature on both priming and subconscious awareness.
Which technique would be more beneficial

## Don't spell it out
Humans have small working memories. Lots of specs make decision making harder and increase the likelihood that a consumer will be dissatisfied with their decision.

## Don't spell it out II
Grawlix and other regularly used graphic figures
Here's a good list of the names of lots of graphic representations of motion

Somewhere in my notes I have evidence that these glyphs exist because people see them.

## Symmetry

## Geometry I
Modrian tests by Ed and April.

## Geometry II
1. Ask my Dad what he thinks could be meant by perfect geometry
1.1. The thing to do would be to put together some meaningless icons with different geometries and check people's preferences.
2. Do people's preferences follow any aesthetic?
3. Has anyone produced a study on this yet
4. The iCloud example
5. Do you need IRB approval to do a survey on the Turk?

## Fractalness
I largely covered this one for Ed's class.  Check out Pollack paper from Science.

## The (hoped for) death of gotcha advertising and the resurgence of relevance
What's the point of ReadabiIity, and can web advertising survive if it continues to be annoying? Cite The Deck as an example of good advertising. Attention is the ultimate commodity these days; relevance now matters more than gotcha.

+ An article on gaze-tracking; left-to-right salience matters in judgement ut not cross-culturally
+ Breaking designs and images into thirds or then golden triangle; why does that work?
+ Fractal dimensions and familiarity
+ Do people sympathize more with people who are hapless or happy? If the product solves your problem, is that better than it makes you cool or awesome at your job?
+ Why we should fight against advertising to children
+ The difference to human eyes with regard to projected versus reflected light, or why web pages should be a white type on a dark background. Roger Black was really wrong.
+ Is KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) a real neurological phenomenon?
+ The hierarchy of perceptual attention. Feature-based searching and integration here.
+ What's in a foreground? How the visual system distinguishes what is in front of everything else.
+ Color?
+ The grid and what Mondrian had right; visual spatial orientation
+ Simplicity theory
+ Anjan Chatterjee might have some good research for Neuroscience of Design: "Temporal order judgement" is an interesting concept--which shape appeared first?
+ What information is compressed into a hyperlink? Talk about Suck and the potential for the Economist to have reinvented web navigation and influenced journalism
+ Truly device-independent web sites--is there an ideal column width or is the matter cultural?

Maybe each article could start with "The design principle:" and the "The Science:"--seems like a nice straightforward format--a kind of abstract for both arts.

The introduction should be about how the division of art and science (or more importantly, engineering) is an artificial distinction. I.e. My conversation with Amy; print designers better know paper. Also, my conversation with my Dad that even Math is an art.

Why do the Mac iTunes, Windows iTunes, and iPhone look different? Does this help human working-memory? Are aesthetics as important as usability? When and for what purpose?
