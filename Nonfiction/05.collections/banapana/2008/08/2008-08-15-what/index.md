"I have a lot of faith in the corporate world because it's always gonna be there so you may as well have faith in it because if you don't then that's just not good." - Luke McCabe, Professional Moron

I just got finished watching "\[The Corporation\](http://www.thecorporation.com/)," which deserves an entire post unto itself, but first this. In the movie are featured two doe-eyed teenagers from California who actually got FirstUSA to sponsor them to go to college. It was during an interview with the two that McCabe stated the above. Let's parse this statement, shall we? First let's break it down into some simpler fragments:

1\. I possess faith in the corporate world 2. The corporate world is always going to be there 3. You should have faith in the corporate world 4. Not possessing faith in the corporate world is bad

The first thing that struck about this young shill's statement is that he used a religiously heavy word with regard to businesses. Wikipedia says "Faith is a belief in the trustworthiness of an idea." So, to rid ourselves of the epistemological difficulty of thinking that it's possible to \*not\* believe that corporations exist, let's use the word "trust."

1\. I trust the corporate world. 2. The corporate world deserves this trust by existing in perpetuity. 3. You should trust the corporate world. 4. Not trusting the corporate world is bad.

You could take statements 1 and 3 and combine them since they are both advocating the same thing: we should trust the corporate world, and this is really the conclusion.

1\. The corporate world deserves our trust by existing in perpetuity. 2. Not trusting the corporate world is bad. 3. We should trust the corporate world.

Boy has this kid drank the kool-aid. The University of Southern California clearly had its work cut out for them.
