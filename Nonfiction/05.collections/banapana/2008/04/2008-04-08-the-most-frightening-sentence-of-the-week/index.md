If you delve into the news (especially science news) you're just bound to run into some pretty frightening ideas, be they predictions or developments. In \[discussing\](http://discovermagazine.com/2007/dec/long-live-closed-source-software) the nature of open source software versus closed source, \[Jaron Lanier\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron\_Lanier) mentions an interesting metaphor with regard to genetics. Lanier cites a \[Freeman Dyson piece\](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20370) in which \[Dyson\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman\_Dyson) describes the early stages of evolution as "open source"---in the sense that genes moved freely between species as tradable bits of code. That alone was news to me, but after I thought about it, it wasn't such a strange idea that our concept of Darwinian evolution---namely the natural selection of genes in organisms---doesn't necessarily occur at the beginning stages of the development of life.

Life would have had to be simpler than creatures with genetic components---possibly even just genes in a primordial goo. But given that, Lanier goes on to say "Freeman suggests that the coming era of synthetic biology will be a return to Eden," and by that he means, the earliest stages of the development of life. In other words, the advent of \[synthetic biology\](http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jan/genetics/#6) could mean that a whole lot of new life is going to crop up without ancestors.\[^1\] "Species boundaries will be defunct, and genes will fly about, resulting in an orgy of creativity." Is it just me or is that just a really frightening concept? Especially "orgy." In fact, I'd have to say, that when scientists are speaking to a public that is \[well-known to be apprehensive about certain topics\](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060810-evolution.html) that's about the worst phrasing of that particular concept I can imagine. I mean, it seems almost deliberately inflammatory. The metaphor is that of a barely controlled... and sticky siutation; not a laboratory. I'm not sure I think its responsible language coming from a scientist.

At any rate, Dyson, for me, really brings the idea home when he asks what the world will be like when the people that run the \[dog show\](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218839/) have total control over the canine genome. Well, among other things, there will be a lot more \[stupid looking dogs\](http://faildogs.com/post/30796381) that \[can't naturally reproduce\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog#Health).

\[^1\]:Dare we call it Intelligent Design? Tee hee.
