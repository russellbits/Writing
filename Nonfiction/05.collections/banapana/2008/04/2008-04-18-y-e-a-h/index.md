I've had quite a few debates with editors and various other people over the correct spelling of the word yeah.  It is not y-a-y.  That is the cheer, as in "Yay! Meatballs again."  And it's not y-a, as in "Ya' know"---or the contraction for you.  But some people remain unconvinced and I think the best way to illustrate the point is to listen very carefully to \[the way the word is pronounced\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF3z-j8o39I) in Fargo.  Enjoy.

By the by, I put this lovely little posting in Meme Safari because Andy Balo over at \[waxy.org\](http://waxy.org) says he's identified a new meme---the \*\_supercut\_\*.  Check out \[his article\](http://waxy.org/2008/04/fanboy\_supercuts\_obsessive\_video\_montages/) on the supercut to see more wonderful and ridiculous edits of movies and shows.  And even though it technically doesn't fit the supercut mememold, I'm just going to mention \[the Vader Sessions\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A0rwG39Jzk) again because it's still hilarious.
