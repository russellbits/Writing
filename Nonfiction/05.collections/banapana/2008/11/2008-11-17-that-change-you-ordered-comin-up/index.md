The Obama transition team launched this new web site, \[Change.gov\](http://change.gov/) in order to keep the public informed on the transition team's decisions and news. They are also soliciting information from the public---so go tell them what you think! I, for one, think that this web site, among other statements that President-elect Obama has made about making government transparent is a fantastic sign of things to come.\[^1\] Take a look at the current \[White House web site\](http://whitehouse.gov) and try to imagine what it's going to look in the next year---a new generation is what. Given the large amount of importance that online efforts played in the President-elect's campaign, I think we can expect it to play a large role in his administration.

\[^1\]: Not to mention his \[significant support for the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act\](http://obama.senate.gov/issues/good\_government\_responsible\_spending/) that would actually create a searchable database of Federal spending \*open to the public\*. Talk about accountability!
