Wow.  I can't believe that it has been three weeks since I last posted.  However, I did not give up the blog, I just had to move to Louisville.  From here, I will begin the arduous process of earning a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology.  Woo hoo.  I'm very excited about it although it has begun \[rather ominously\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate\_prior). Nonetheless, I will soldier on and continue to update this blog with my progress, and of course, any news about our minds on media.

To that end, I just noticed something funny about media. There's a great vlog that I watch called Cranky Geeks (choose your medium \[here\](http://www.crankygeeks.com/)). The other day they had an episode dedicated to the future of journalism. Between breaks on the show, they have a little gimmick where they post and define some technical terms. So, for the future of journalism show, all the words were technical print terms like "color key" and "press proof." That's the future for ya!!
