Wow. \[A stoopid filter\](http://stupidfilter.org/) for the web. It's about time. Generally speaking I hang around on sites with pretty smart readers who make insightful commentary. But every now and then, when visiting Youtube, I forget to avoid the comments, and then the rage begins. If these guys can actually create a filter that will allow me to ignore the ignorance, rudeness, and stupidity of comments on some web sites, I think they deserve a Nobel. You have the right to say whatever you want, but I have the right to jam my fingers in my ears and sing "la la la!" while you talk.
