I have to hand it to Sarah Schmelling over at McSweeney's for having the bright idea to re-write \[Hamlet as a series of Facebook updates\](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2008/7/30schmelling.html). Probably my favorite line was "Hamlet's father is now a zombie."â€”a slight plot change of course, but acceptable.
