This is really exceptional. Â The latest Radiohead \[music video for "House of Cards"\](http://buzzfeed.com/scott/radiohead-house-of-cards-video) was filmed entirely without cameras, using instead, only lasers to scan the scenery and actors. The images seem weirdly realistic in their depth and motion; more so than video to me. The link above gets you the music video and the "making of" video as well. This imagery is so entirely appropriate for this haunting ballad---by far one of my favorites off of \[In Rainbows\](http://www.inrainbows.com/).
