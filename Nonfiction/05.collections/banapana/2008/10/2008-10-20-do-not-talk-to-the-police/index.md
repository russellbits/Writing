In lieu of my recent posting on brain scans and the 5th amendment, I'd like to post this great video that will give you several good reasons (from an attorney) as to why you should never talk to the police and why your 5th amendment right may be your most important in this century. In short, there are so many federal codes, so many laws, you cannot know when you are incriminating yourself. It takes a lawyer. Professor James Duane, "Everything you tell the police can be used against you. It cannot be used \*for\* you."
