Wow. Has it really been this long since I've blogged? Bad blogger! Anyway, four-day weekend, this one, so look forward to lots more. For now, though, laugh sadly at the economy and the fact that someone was enough of a smartass to spray paint the \[Wall Street Bull's balls blue\](http://gothamist.com/2008/10/09/wall\_street\_needs\_relief\_in\_more\_wa.php). A better editorial on the financial sector I think there is not.
