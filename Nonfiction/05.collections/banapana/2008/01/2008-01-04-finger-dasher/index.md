Dasher is a novel piece of software that lets you point at what you want to write. Honestly, it's kind of difficult to describe without \[seeing the demonstration\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6yIquOKQ0). It's very novel and makes novel use of some simple AI. I wonder if Apple would ever integrate this in to the iPhone? And it would seem to be of great use were it to be integrated into eye tracking software.
