It looks like some folks in the UK have had enough with the \[CCTV surveillance\](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in\_article\_id=459200&in\_page\_id=1770). The UK has the highest density of surveillance cameras of any western nation, with 1 for every 14 people. And there are special ones just to catch you speeding with the cute colloquial nomenclature of \[gatso\](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gatsos). So, Motorists Against Detection (MAD) is having at it and \[taking the gatsos out\](http://www.speedcam.co.uk/index2.htm)â€”in some cases even resorting to dynamite.
