If you need to be convinced of the pervasiveness of cameras in our society, look no further then the web site, \[No Photography Allowed\](http://www.strictlynophotography.com/), which is a gallery of photos taken in places you're not supposed to take pictures. Take that, Privacy! Take that, Copyright! A nice one-two punch.
