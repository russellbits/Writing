There are a lot of Web 2.0 folks out there competing for the gold medal in online To do list application. There's a clear winner. It's \[Todoist\](http://www.todoist.com). Why? For starters---and this is precisely why I realized I had to actually blog about the service as opposed to just use it---rather than just import it into my iGoogle home page, I just made it my home page on all my machines. It's that useful. The first thing I want to see when I wake up is Todoist.

Todoist deserves awesome props on two counts having to do with its very Taoist inspired design. Is there a design? In a very minimalist, get-out-of-your-way sense there certainly is. And this is a good thing; software design should know its place. Todo lists are (let's be honest) a dime a dozen. Todoist seems to implicitly acknowledge this by not adding a lot of graphics and fuss. It is, after all, a list.

But do not be fooled by its simple aesthetic! The site makes massive use of AJAX that really dazzles once you get the hang of it. And it integrates with LOTS of other applications. Todoist would seem to have the ultimate API, integrating with every application I could possibly think of. Gmail integration, widgets, iGoogle and on and on. The premium account is $3 a month! That's the right price for these kinds of web services. The only thing left for me to do now is build Wordpress integration plugin. I love it that much!

Possibly one of the most brilliant features (and there are a lot to choose from) is the semantics of the date entry. You don't say that a todo has a deadline on 3-28-09. You just type "tomorrow" or "Sunday" or "Monday" Brilliant!

I've used them all, folks: \[tadalist\](http://www.tadalist.com/), \[rememberthemilk\](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/), and \[backpack\](http://www.backpackit.com/), and todoist just rules them all. They have a nice catchphrase on their site:

\>Warning: High usage of Todoist may result in an organized life :)

You better believe it!

Now that I've evangelized this gorgeous piece of software; here's my one wish: some way to track my todos once they're done. There is a history and an archive feature and you can see every todo you've finished; but given that there is a feature that lets you repeat todos every day or two days or every week, it would be really nice to see a chart of my accomplishments. Hey, Amir, I program--want help!? Did I already say that I love todoist that much?

But anybody can dream up features. Sign up for this service because it will deliver on its tagline: you will become more organized. And for someone like me---in which case that's a struggle---oh, todoist makes it so easy.
