Recently debated \[here at Banapana\](/creative-communism/is-graphic-design-art) and \[elsewhere\](http://isgraphicdesignart.com/) was the question: is graphic design art? As I stated before, I think that graphic design is a craft and that it can achieve art when it is practiced with mastery. \[^1\] One example of that sort of mastery can be found on \[Andy Mangold's site\](http://www.andymangold.com/monopoly-repackaging/) where he has re-designed the monopoly game packaging. It is a stunning as well as functional re-design. It is, in short, a mastery of the craft. The aesthetic changes would increase the perceived value of the game, and the re-organization of the game pieces simply makes it easier to take care of and play. Brilliant.

And for those of you who have been looking for a good Monopoly strategy, I suggest you take a look at this \[simple instructive video\](http://www.jakeandamir.com/post/59690672/monopoly).

\[^1\]: Not to belabor the point, but mastering a craft and creating fine art are not the same thing. Fine art has a singular purpose that has nothing to do with function or communication; which craft and design are concerned with. Anyway, you can read \[my thoughts on the matter\](/creative-communism/is-graphic-design-art).
