I missed this the first time around, I guess, since it was posted over at \[23/6\](236.com) towards the end of October. But \[this video\](http://www.236.com/video/2008/watch\_synchronized\_presidentia\_9857.php) of all three debates synchronized really makes you wonder whether the Presidential debates are worth watching at all. I enjoyed the occasional cleverness in them, but I explicitly remember not gaining any new information.
