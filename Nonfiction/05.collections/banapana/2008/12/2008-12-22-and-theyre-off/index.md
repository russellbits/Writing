Not much more needs to be said than there is this headline from the \[BBC\](http://news.bbc.co.uk): "\[Breast Cancer Gene-free Baby Due\](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7792318.stm)." This is the beginning of the designer baby revolution and a new stage in human evolution. I don't want to be the kind of writer that proselytizes this as the beginning of the end \*or\* something that's going to get underway tomorrow, but it's no doubt a \[callsign\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callsign). Any ethics debate has already been all but left behind and the \[girls of San Fernando Valley\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley\_girl) are only going to get prettier before anyone in Congress decides that they need to have a say in the matter. No, it's looking more and more like \[Freeman Dyson's vision\](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20370) is coming true and that the future of human genetics is open source.
