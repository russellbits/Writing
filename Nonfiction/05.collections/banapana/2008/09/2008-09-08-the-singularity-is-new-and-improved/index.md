I have to set this joke up a bit for some of you. \[Vernor Vinge\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor\_Vinge) is a mathematician and science fiction writer from out of \[San Diego State\](http://www.sdsu.edu/). Some years ago he proposed that there would be (in the future) a kind of intelligence explosion---that as technology became intelligent, humans would no longer even be able to keep up with the massive changes brought on by new artificial species capable of re-inventing themselves thousands of times faster than evolution could change biological species. So, with that as background, I found \[this astute and funny\](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/aaronson-on-sin.html) comment over at \[Overcoming Bias\](http://www.overcomingbias.com).

if the Singularity ever does arrive, I expect it to be plagued by frequent outages and terrible customer service. ...
