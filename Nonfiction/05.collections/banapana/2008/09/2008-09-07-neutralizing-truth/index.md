 ###The Pentagon's Unmanned Spokesdrone

Personally, though, I always thought it was more effective when the unmanned drone was made to look like an \[attractive woman\](http://images.google.com/images?q=dana+perino&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&oi=image\_result\_group&resnum=1&ct=title). Or am I just thinking of Battlestar Galactica?
