It is amazing, when the facts are laid out truthfully in graphic form, the story that they can tell. \[Chart Junk\](http://chartjunk.karmanaut.com/taxplans/) has posted \[a chart\](http://chartjunk.karmanaut.com/taxplans/) that should rightfully outrage any American. Brilliantly illustrated. Maddeningly frustrating information. The great thing about this chart is that you don't need to read to get it. I \*desperately, desperately\* want a courageous debate mediator to show both the candidate this chart and ask them about it.
