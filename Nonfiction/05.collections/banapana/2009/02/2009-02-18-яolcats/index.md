Well, just when you thought \[the world's most popular meme\](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21988724-2,00.html) just couldn't get any better, it goes and \[mutates\](http://rolcats.com/) in order to better reflect the cultures of Eastern Bloc countries. That's right commrades, be mindful of the \[Яolcats\](http://rolcats.com/). It appears that the days of \[Glasnost\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost) for kitties are still ahead for us.
