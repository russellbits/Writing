You saw what \[the world looked like\](http://projects.flowingdata.com/inauguration/) when the inauguration was twittered.  Now the New York Times has a nice twitter \[visualization of the Super Bowl\](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/02/02/sports/20090202\_superbowl\_twitter.html).  My favorite part is watching the world's collective consciousness synchronously call out for Springsteen!
