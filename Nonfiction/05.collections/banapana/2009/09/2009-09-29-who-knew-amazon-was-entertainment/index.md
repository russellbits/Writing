I like hanging around on Amazon, perusing the numerous objects of necessity-filling that I had not known previously existed, but who knew that the reviews themselves could be hilarious? Take \[milk\](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032G1S0/ref=cm\_rdp\_product). At first glance, you might think, "Sure I could review milk. It might taste good or bad or creamy or not," et cetera. But then, you would not be taking full advantage of the \[potential absurdity\](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2POWVSYG9WR5P/ref=cm\_cr\_rdp\_perm) available to reviews of milk---or the \[ridiculous uses\](http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZ4T80F2DBUV/ref=cm\_cr\_rdp\_perm) of said milk! Me, personally, I started with the \[1 star\](http://www.amazon.com/Tuscan-Whole-Milk-Gallon-128/product-reviews/B00032G1S0/ref=cm\_cr\_dp\_hist\_1?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&filterBy=addOneStar) reviews of milk, because bad reviews are funnier. Nonetheless, there are \[gems\](http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIFQ5SIX8AFU/ref=cm\_cr\_rdp\_perm) throughout.

\[Hat tip to \[Marginal Revolution\](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/09/reviews-of-milk.html) for spotting this inanity.\]
