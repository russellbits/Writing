I just saw the fail whale for the first time today in a long while (months maybe)? And I'm pretty sure that \[this nifty radio network\](http://blip.fm) is to blame. It certainly appeared on my own memetic map rather suddenly. Within a day, it seemed like, a large number of people I follow and folks who follow me on \[twitter\](http://twitter.com) were to be found on \[blip.fm\](http://blip.fm) tweeting away at their favorite tracks. It's no Pandora killer, and I think some of the novelty will where off rather quick, but if you've got a tune you want everyone to know about, this is a great tool. I have a feeling some lucky band is going to get rocketed to some new level of stardom with a system like this.
