Well, I would really rather be developing a new iPod touch app, but Xcode won't quit quitting on me and the Apple Developer Connection is away for lunch (or site updating)---probably something to do with this rumored iPhone OS \[copy and paste\](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/03/15/iphone-3-0-copy-and-paste-described/) I've been hearing about. At any rate, since the development train is pulled into the station for a moment, allow me to instead share with you this gorgeous collection of posters that I found at \[Poster Cabaret\](http://postercabaret.com/index.aspx). Pretty.

\* \*Update 2:55pm\*: The rumors are true; there will be copy and paste in iPhone 3.0.
