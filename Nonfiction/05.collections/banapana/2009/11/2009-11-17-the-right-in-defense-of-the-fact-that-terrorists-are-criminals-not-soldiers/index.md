> "I agree with Grover Norquist."

This was in response to \[statements\](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/11/conservatives-say-gitmo-detainees-would-be-fine-in-il-prison-warn-gop-of-scaremongering.php) by well-known conservatives: former Republican Congressman and Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr, David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union and Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform; in which, they cautioned against scaremongering with regard to trying terrorists in the US. This is just more evidence to the contrary that, despite their claims of a "win" this last election day, the Republican party is very much in danger of becoming a jingoist fringe party. As an independent, I worry more about that. Two corporate-run parties is bad enough, but a lame, irrelevant we're-really-mad party and the corporate-run Democrats would be a much worse situation. Where is \[Buckley\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William\_F.\_Buckley,\_Jr.)!?
