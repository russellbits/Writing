There was a recent survey on my campus as to whether the campus library should keep video games on hand. In the comments section, i wrote this (with sincerity)

> Aside from the obvious reasons to do this, there is merit in it. Video games now often outsell films on their first day of sale. For not only this reason, they have become significant culturally. If you want to truly understand a culture from a particular time period, look to their pulp fiction. Video games are the pulp fiction of our day and should be preserved by libraries for that value. Also, it would really be aw3s0m3.
