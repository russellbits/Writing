Now and then \[Daring Fireball\](http://daringfireball.net) throws \[a link\](http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/235455865/the-many-sliders-of-photoshop-cs4) my way that, for the thousandth time, reminds me how glad I am I don't deal with Adobe software anymore. They have literally reached the heights of Microsoft-level disdain for ugliness and shoddiness. I mean, when an \[entire blog\](http://adobegripes.tumblr.com/) is dedicated to illustrating how much your software stinks, how do you not make a clean-up effort? Photoshop started doing SO much that I didn't need it to do and started getting in my way so badly version after version that I finally made the permanent switch to \[Acorn\](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/). Photoshop and Illustrator were the only programs on my machine that crashed with any regularity (and it was regular---almost clockwork). I probably wouldn't have been able to rid myself of those curses if I were still a professional designer, but as a free-ranging artist, I have the pleasure of not running any of Adobe's bloatware on my machine anymore.
