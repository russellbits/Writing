Well, I tried a new experiment with my favorite online tool, twitter. I thought it might be fun to compose them into digests and post them daily here. As far as experiments go, it was quite a successful one since it proved \*three\* things to me. One, it's a stupid idea and made a mess of the blog. Two, one is largely due to the fact that I twitter \*way\* more than I blog right now. I've discovered a whole great gaggle of pithy writers on \[favrd.com\]() who are nothing like the ego massaging masses of twitterers who write compelling cliffhangers like "I've got a headache" or "I'm going to bed." Anyway, if you poke around on Favrd for long enough, you'll find most of them. I enjoy competing for favorite stars. Someday someone will learn how to spam Favrd and that will be a sad day, but I don't sense this trend coming to an end for at least another 6 months. It reminds me of the early days of the blogosphere, those rough-tough ragged days when you could stake a claim just about anywhere on the world wide web and set yourself up a nice little blog. People argued back then that blogs seemed trivial and useless---little more than diaries made public. Oh, how \[wrong you were\](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-new-newsweekcom-2009-5) naysayers. And twitter seems to be causing \[a similar hubabaloo\](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/12/twitter-traffic-surpasses\_n\_202003.html). So, I think there's good uses for twitter, aside from adding another awkward verb to the English:

\> I wish I lived in the heyday of ham radio. Because I would call it Hamming. Everyone would be like, "Huh?" And I'd be like, "Just wait."

\> The Beloved Leader, \[via Twitter\](http://twitter.com/belovedleader/)

The second thing that I learned from this experiment was that what I like to write on Twitter has nothing to do with what I like to write on Banapana. Admittedly, I've been loosening up on the syntax here on Banapana---makes it easier to write more---but I'm still writing about particular subject matters, not stuff like this:

\>The evidence is mounting, and scientists agree, global idiocy is an increasing concern--possibly doubling by the year 2010

\> The Beloved Leader, \[via Twitter\](http://twitter.com/belovedleader/)

That there's a legitimate place to put a thought like that on the Internet?---now that's just fun! So, it looks like Twitter is just entertainment! Who knew that enforcing a 140 character limit would make email fun? So, at any rate, I am for the moment considering posting a twitter digest of my best from the week here, but no more daily updates. It makes a mess.
