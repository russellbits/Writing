I recently returned from a \[beautiful trip\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/troped/sets/72157621972572876/) to Amsterdam where for four days of my ten day trip I was conferring with cognitive scientists at the \[Cognitive Science 2009 Conference\](http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference2009/index.html). I am very proud to say that a paper of mine on search and prediction was accepted in to the proceedings and I was asked to make a poster presentation.\[^1\] For posterity I've put the poster up \[here on Banapana\](http://banapana.com/cogsci09-poster) for anyone curious. Questions are welcome in the comments on this post or in the comments section on \[the poster page\](http://banapana.com/cogsci09-poster).

\[^1\]: My paper was co-authored with my advisor \[Patrick Shafto\](http://louisville.edu/psychology/shafto/people/patrick-shafto.html) of the \[University of Louisville\](http://louisville.edu), as well as \[Chris Baker\](http://web.mit.edu/clbaker/www/) and \[Joshua Tenenbaum\](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) of the \[MIT Computational Cognitive Science Group\](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/). Many thanks go to them for helping me obtain my first academic publication!
