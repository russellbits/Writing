This is one of the funnier incidents of media serendipity I've seen in a while. Of course, I love to cover events when people spy on the government or the government spies on people, but here we have regular old people "spying" on regular old people. Robert Palmer, a graphic designer who's been making some noise with \[his revamp\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/robertpalmer/3743826461/) of the \[Republican Health Nightcare Chart\](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/07/when\_health-care\_reform\_stops.html), also happened to spot some kids from his Hilton hotel room \[taking a picture of their cars\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/robertpalmer/3412382473/). And then, in a way that could only happen in the 21st century's media mania, he found \[the pictures they were taking\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/genuinedesigns/3414830063/). I just feel like it's worth mentioning because it helps me to hone my sense of just what \[banapana\](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=banapana) is.
