Like a lot of Daily Show watchers, I tend to go out and look at the books that John touts. I generally check them at the library first though, because now and then it seems like a literary agent calls in a favor on the show. That's how I felt about \[Thomas Friedman's\](http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/) "The World is Flat." I checked it out, started reading it and couldn't get past the third chapter. It's not just silly writing, it's unsubstantiated by nearly any facts other than anecdote; which just doesn't constitute an economic treatise in my opinion. It was really just a long editorial at that and one I was fairly determined to write a criticism of here. But, alas, now I know that will never happen because I have read \[this criticism\](http://www.nypress.com/article-19271-flat-n-all-that.html) of Thomas Freidman by Matt Taibbi and I could never ever write one as well he has. His commentary is deadly sharp, accurate, and almost excruciating to read. I almost, \*almost\* feel bad for Mr. Friedman. Not to mention, this criticism produced brilliant charts like the one below. How could you \*not\* want to read an article that has this chart in it? \[caption id="attachment\_648" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Now how could you not want to read an article about this?"\][![Now how could you not want to read an article about this?](assets/images/graph2-300x191.jpg "graph2")](http://www.nypress.com/article-19271-flat-n-all-that.html)\[/caption\]
