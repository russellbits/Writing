"\[World Builder\](http://www.vimeo.com/3365942)" is a very nicely produced (and touching) short film by \[Bruce Banit\](http://www.vimeo.com/user1349603). From the \[Vimeo\](http://www.vimeo.com/) page: "A strange man builds a world using holographic tools for the woman he loves." This is the kind of virtual reality I long for, even if it were just on the Xbox. All the first-person shooter games are great fun, but I wish developers would invest more time in games/open-ended environments like this. I know, of course, that some will point out that \[Second Life\](http://secondlife.com/) is close, but their rendering engine still doesn't match what the shooter games manage.\[^1\]

\[^1\]: Of course, I haven't been in Second Life for about a year and a half--maybe it's time to re-visit.
