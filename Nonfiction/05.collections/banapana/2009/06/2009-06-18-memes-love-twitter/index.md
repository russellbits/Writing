While scientists have really yet to hit on a good model for the concept of the \[meme\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme), it still serves as a great metaphor, the genes unit of culture, spreading through minds at sometimes rapid paces. It seems that all we've done with the web and the web and the Internet have given memes even greater opportunity to spread and spread further. In a showing of solidarity with protesters from Iran, twitterers are putting a transparent green overlay on their profile icons.

Unlike other memes, which seem to pop into your life or your inbox intermittenly, you can watch this meme spreading in real-time just by watching twitter feeds. I feel like I'm watching people get colds, though. Yuck.
