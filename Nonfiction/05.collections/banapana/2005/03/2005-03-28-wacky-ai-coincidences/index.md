So this last weekend, I had just [finished reading](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/03/on_intelligence_1.html) Jeff Hawkins' great little tome, "[On Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=wwwrussellwar-20&path=tg/detail/-/0805074562/qid=1111965110/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)" in which he lays out a hypothesis for how the human neocortex works and then goes on to discuss how we could build intelligent machines based on the model he presents. Then, of course, the [rat-brain flying the plane](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/03/rat_brain_flies.html) shows up. And NOW, I just found a [trailer](http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/stealth/) for a movie called [Stealth](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/stealth/), starring Jamie Foxx that features -- you guessed it -- an intelligent stealth bomber that gets shocked by lightning ([number-5 alive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9b258ZmI9dXxwbj0wfHE9c2hvcnQgY2lyY3VpdHxodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1)!) and turns EVIL and must be stopped. I feel like I'm on some kind of bizarre carousel this week.
