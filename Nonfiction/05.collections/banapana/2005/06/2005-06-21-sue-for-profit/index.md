In yet another story about a company attempting to [sue its way into profitabiltiy](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/start.html?pg=13), a company called Contois is [suing Apple Computer](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/21/1418250&tid=155) for infringing its patents regarding music playing software. Among Apple's horrific violations of Contois's patent are a computer program that can have buttons to start and stop music. I don't usually root for Apple's lawyers but at least in this case I hope they crush Contois. Anybody who has the audacity to sue for the sole purpose of [generating an income](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/start.html?pg=13) deserves to be crushed! Go Apple lawyers! Sic 'em!
