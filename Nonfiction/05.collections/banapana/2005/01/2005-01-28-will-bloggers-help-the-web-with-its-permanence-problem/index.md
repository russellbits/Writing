I just clicked on the umpteenth link to Yahoo News from [David Devitry's blog](http://www.devitry.com/) and got a "Document Not Found" page. It bothers me that there are facts in the news that vanish like that. For one, it feels like evidence that our society is ever more rapidly consuming things -- even news. But it does make me wonder if the blog phenomenon will help keep information more permanent thorugh the posting and cross-posting and track-backing. I'm sure many blogs will go away in time but not likely the majority of them.

Anyway, if not, there's always the [Wayback Machine](http://www.archive.org/)
