As a writer with a large number of interests it was hard for me to decide what precisely this blog was going to be about. Picking any one subject would be about impossible since on any given day I'm thinking about a few. Then it dawned on me that another project I have going -- namely my research notebook for my writing -- was for all practical purposes a blog. If this blog doesn't end up being that interesting to the public, at the very least it'll serve as a good digital notebook for me.
