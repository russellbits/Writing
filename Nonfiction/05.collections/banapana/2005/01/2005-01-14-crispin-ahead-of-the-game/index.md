[Advertising Age](http://www.advertisingage.com/) named [Crispin](http://www.cpbmiami.com/) "Agency of the Year" this week. \*YAWN\*. Considering the fact that I think advertising is a dying animal I wouldn't normally be too concerned about this particular announcement -- except for the fact that Crispin is apparently responsible for just about every ad campaign that caught my eye this year for innovation. We're talking [subserviant chicken](http://www.subservientchicken.com/). We're talking [Molson's](http://www.molsonusa.com/) fake site/magazine stunt. Wow. The creative director says that they are and wish to remain to be media agnostic. Sweeter words were never heard. It's about damn time that someone in the advertising industry realized that you start with an idea and move out to the media. Vertically separated department are dead.
