Of course, it won't _always_ figure out what you're thinking but I found it was right a fair amount of time. it even knew enough to tell me when to [get my mind out of the gutter](http://y.20q.net/anon?RDnQ691eK9YdGuYFbuHVxqAS642qC,eZO-eQrBvTvRZ,pdNnq4X6C!j6DRLxcMWxuHKtkMkx.ZPhNL6QW,Z,!8kMl2rIbqOpluqKvYu71JOpmqAS_R_pnsFPKbvn7q2ezjiwYJiH6xWgwHFP791mTUrUbXw7UCBi!JOpZvc).
