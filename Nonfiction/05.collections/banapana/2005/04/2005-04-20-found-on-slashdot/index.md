I found this clip on slashdot and thought it was worth re-posting here. I despise [Clippy](http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/clippy/screenshots.shtml) and his little Banana3000 rip-off counterpart on the Mac. I thought this was a great reply to some folks questioning the fact that Microsoft apparently [patented a method](http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/05/04/20/136212.shtml?tid=155&tid=109) of accessing data used by emergency services. Hi! I'm Clippy!

You seem to be in a firefight with Muslim extremists! Would you like to:

- Hit the dirt?
- Blow away Mohammed?
- Ask George Bush why 1317 days after 9/11, Osama bin Laden still hasn't been captured, even though we've given the Iraqis "The Gift of Democracy"?
- Surrender your essential liberties for a little temporary security?
