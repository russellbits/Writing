As you may or may not know, I am a designer at [Glow Interactive](http://www.glowinteractive.com) and I feel the need to shamlessly promote them a bit today. Yesterday the [Ali G](http://www.disbealig.com/) site created for HBO was nominated for a Webby Award in the category of [Best Practices](http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/categories.php#best_practices). You can can go to the People's Voice Awards [section of the site](http://pv.webbyawards.com/) and cast a vote for the site!
