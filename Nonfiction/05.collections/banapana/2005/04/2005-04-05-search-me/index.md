While reading about [privacy and search engines](http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,67062,00.html) I had a thought: wouldn't it be nice to be able to create a [watchlist](http://www.technorati.com/members/) about yourself? Of course, vanity was slightly involved in this thought, but mostly I'm interested in knowing two things: how many/who is searching for me and where am I popping up? The only thing I can't figure out is how to insure that the search monitoring is mostly tracking me specifically as opposed to all the other [Russell Warners](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Russell+warner&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) out there.
