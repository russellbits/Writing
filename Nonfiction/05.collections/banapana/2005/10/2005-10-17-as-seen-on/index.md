I posted my thoughts about [user expectations](http://www.guuui.com/posting.php?id=1704) regarding search over on The GUI designer's coffee break. Here's what I said:

> "It's interesting to note that several of these expectations stem from searches being based on loaded results from another server and the necessity of typing in a full query before seeing any results. "Live" searches such as the one in Apple spotlight and some being implemented via AJAX on the web change this. Here's [one example](http://tauquil.com/archives/2005/08/02/livesearch-in-action/). On my blog, I've made the argument several times that search engines should also be capable of [chatbot behavior](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/09/google_should_b.html). It should engage this behavior when an intelligible phrase would allow it to walk users through to more accurate information. Google's "Did you mean?" functionality is a good start but lots more could be done with it. Combine that functionality with live search and I think the result would be very powerful.

Powerful is maybe even an understatement. A well-thought out chat/search bot with live results and recommendation capabilities could be insanely great. I've learned enough about web services that it may be time I start thinking about building this concept in Flash.
