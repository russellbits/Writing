Until today I had never heard of Peter Morville which is quite a surprise considering who he is and what he thinks about. After taking a look at his book, [Ambient Findability](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=wwwrussellwar-20&creative=9325&path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007655)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwrussellwar-20&l=ur2&o=1) and reading this very [interesting interview](http://tagsonomy.com/index.php/peter-morville-the-tagsonomy-interview/) over at [You're It](http://tagsonomy.com/) I will have to add his name to my watch list. After reading what he had to say, I'll have to update both my articles on [Trusted Searching](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/09/trusted_searchi.html) and the [Death of the Specialist](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/04/the_death_of_th.html)
