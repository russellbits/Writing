It's nice the way Wikipedia indicates when you are going to jump off their site with a small link indicator to the right of the link. I intend on writing more articles within Banapana defining a lot of what an upcoming book of mine will encompass, and I wanted to use the site as more of reference (mostly for myself but also for others). I felt like it would be worth it then to distinguish between links within Banapana and links leading elsewhere. So, in the spirit of Wikipedia, I've created three link indicators that will tell you when you're leaving the site \[![](assets/images/external.png)\], when you are clicking on a link that will pass you through to amazon via my associates account \[![](assets/images/amazon.png)\] and whne a link references the Wikipedia \[![](assets/images/wikipedia.png)\]. I especially think that the second indicator could prove to be useful to bloggers who want to monetize their links.
