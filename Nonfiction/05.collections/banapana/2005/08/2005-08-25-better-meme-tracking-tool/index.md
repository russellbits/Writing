Icerocket has developed a [great little tool](http://trend.icerocket.com/) that allows you to track trends on the web (or at least number of blog references). I tried one for President Bush vs Dubya. Apparently even bloggers possess a good deal of respect for the office since references to President Bush widely outnumbered references to Dubya.
