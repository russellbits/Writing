In what appears to be yet another failure of our popularityand ratings driven media, I found this [story](http://www.gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=49&row=1) by Greg Palast which was orginally written (and published) in the UK paper, The Guardian. What's freaky about this article is how much dirt its got on Pat Robertson and how none of it is anything I've heard about from a comparable US news source. They're very busy writing about how crazy he is to talk about assassination, but who among them has discussed what a total crook he is?
