If you've heard about the term [folksonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy), then you are likely wondering where it came from. Interestingly, [Atomiq](http://www.atomiq.org) gives a pretty [decent history](http://atomiq.org/archives/2005/08/folksonomies_year_one.html) of the rise of this particular meme. I've [tracked memes before](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/02/creative_commun.html) in a similar fashion to what Atomiq did and in both cases occurences of the meme fluctuate. It's enough to make me wonder if memes over a long run match the [sigmoidal curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_curve). One of the most fascinating things about the development of the web, in my mind, is that memes can be tracked like this to an extent.
