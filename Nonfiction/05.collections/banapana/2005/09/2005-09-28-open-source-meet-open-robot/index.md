Some students at [George Mason University](http://cs.gmu.edu/) have put together a [wiki](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/robots/flockbots/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Home) that will document the construction of a small open source robot (costing roughly $800). I don't have much to add to this other than it's cool and that I've been looking to upgrade from [Mindstorms](http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/default.asp?domainredir=www.legomindstorms.com) for a little while now.
