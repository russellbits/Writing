Over at [jnd.org](http://www.jnd.org), (a site apparently dedicated to usability that does not anywhere on the home page explain what JND stands for) M.E. Conway has posted an [article](http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/the_truth_about_goog.html) criticizing Google's supposed simplicity. I agree on many points. You have to know what to type into the search box to do specific kinds of things, like [site](http://www.google.com/help/refinesearch.html) specific searches or getting [currency and measurement conversions](http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator). If you've never done it before, you're out of luck. The debate, I'm sure will range from add more options to add a few more options to make it look like Yahoo. Not to [beat a dead horse](http://banapana.troped.com/archives/2005/01/command_line_of.html), but none of those options are really the best. Google, for the moment, has a command-line interface. They should just make the back end "understand" what you're looking for by feeding it through a bot.
