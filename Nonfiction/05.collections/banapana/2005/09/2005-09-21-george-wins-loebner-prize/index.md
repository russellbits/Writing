Well, George and his programmer, Rollo Carpenter, [won the prize](http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2142532/brit-program-wins-prize). This is a bit of an upset for those who follow the competition; [Alice](http://www.alicebot.org/), a fairly well-known chatbot created by Dr. Richard Wallace has grabbed the top prize in the contest for the last three years running. However, no bot yet has won the gold medal for convincing a judge that it is a human. While ALICE is based on the popular [AIML](http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html) (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language), the Jabberwacky language appears to be proprietary technology.

\[Blatant personal plug: I have my own version of an AIML bot running on AIM. He's based on the popular cartoon character Master Shake from [Aqua Teen Hunger Force](http://www.adultswim.com/shows/athf/). You can talk to him at his AIM address: mast3rshak3bot. WARNING: The character in the cartoon is hardly polite. Niether is the bot.\]
