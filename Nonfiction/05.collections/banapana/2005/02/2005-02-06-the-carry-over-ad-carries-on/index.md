I think the first ad of this kind that I ever spotted (at least the first one that ever managed to catch my attention) was the seewhathappensnext.com from Mitsubushi (or was it Nissan)---it doesn't appear to be up any longer at any rate? Anyway, the general concept is to hook a viewer with the 30 second spot and then get them to jump online to feed them more information/propaganda. We've got two of these so far: The MacDonald's [Lincoln Fry](http://lincolnfry.yahoo.com/) commercial and site and the [GoDaddy.com](http://www.godaddy.com) see-the-uncensored-version-of-the-spot. It really didn't need to be censored anyway (yawn). The technique makes sese; squeeze too much into a 30 second ad and risk overwhelming your viewer. But build suspense with a hook and you throw much more information at them on the site.
