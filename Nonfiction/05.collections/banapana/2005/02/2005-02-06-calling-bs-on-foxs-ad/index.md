I love the fact that Fox claims that they had to pay 2.4 million dollars for an advertisement for a show on their network. C'mon! "It was worth it." Who do you think you're kidding Fox?

On another note, I'm impressed with [AdJab](http://www.adjab.com) who is blogging all of the superbowl ads in real time with screenshots. That's dedication. I can appreciate the effort but unfortunately I have to actually watch the game. Go Eagles!
