This entry is actually [an attempt](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66599,00.html?tw=wn_story_page_prev2) to help an artist named [David Sullivan](http://www.swampmonster.org/new/egoMachine.htm) retain his ego after he is gone. I'm probably reaching, but I think it is fair to say that David Sullivan is the first human being to utilize Google as a [Deus ex Machina](http://newark.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Terms/deusexmachina.html) for escaping death -- or at least the death of his memory. He has created a web site that is a reflection of how many links and references there are to him on the web according to Google. His image "decomposes" according to these results. I mention it here because of the project's obvious relevance to Banapana but also out of an altruistic desire to help another artist attain immortality (or at least nerd nirvana).
