If a meme's quality is high it will have good copy fidelity -- meaning that it can spread without out being changed too much. I would define a bad meme then as a meme that cannot be replicated in media or language. [These sentences](http://aldaily.com/bwc.htm) then would be some seriously bad memes. I DARE you to try to read, comprehend and repeat them.
