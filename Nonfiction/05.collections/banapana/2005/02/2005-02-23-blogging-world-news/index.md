\[_This is a little off-topic for Banapana but it seemed relevant enough to post here._\]

One of the [bigger stories](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66679,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_3) out in the ether today has been that a guy named Jason Kottke has quit his job and is going to blog full-time. If you're like me (unaware of exactly who he was) you may be inclined to react to the news with a large yawn. However, it should be known that Jason is one of the larger stars in the blog galaxy. And he should be given some credit for doing [something a little different](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000238.html) from the likes of bloggers like [Gizmodo](http://www.gawker.com) and [Gawker](http://www.gawker.com) and dodging the ad revenue model. Good! Advertising on the web is here to stay, surely, but hopefully some folks will keep looking for better models.
