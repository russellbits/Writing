This isn't actually all that new. The article was written in 1999. But we all need the occasional reminder, I guess because [most of these errors](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990530.html "Top-10 New Mistakes of Web Design (Alertbox May 1999)") are still very common in web page designs. Normally I don't enitrely agree with Neilsen because he tends to be a bit of an [anti-asthete](http://www.useit.com/about/nographics.html) (is that a word?) but in this instance he couldn't be more right. I hope he never looks at the [Monkeytronic Circus of Conquest](http://www.monkeytroniccircusofconquest.com)
