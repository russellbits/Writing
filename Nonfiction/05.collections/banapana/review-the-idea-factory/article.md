# The Idea Factory

## Or why we can’t have nice things anymore

The book “The Idea Factory” is a thoroughly engaging and fairly comprehensive history of one of the most unusual institutions in American history: Bell Labs. If you have not heard of it, you have heard of everything they did, because they essentially invented the 21st century as we know it. The transistor, information theory, fiber optics, communication satellites, radar, sonar and lasers. It sounds like a song and the list even goes on. Cell phones, solar cells, The B (for Bell) and C programming languages, the Big Bang Theory. These are all inventions/discoveries of Bell Labs. And I found in this book a big question: where is Bell Labs today? Not where is the actual institution and building, the artifacts and leftovers are all around. Where is the Bell Labs *of* today. Whither the institution? Why can’t we have Bell Labs today in the US?

I don’t feel the need to retread the history of Bell Labs and tell you how incredibly important the place was. There are plenty of histories—“The Idea Factory” being a very good one. The place was an astounding nexus of science, government and industry.

I’m going to start with Karl Marx. This oft misunderstood philosopher spoke a great deal about the simple concept of the firm and its construction. There’s a pretty basic plot to human history and property and it goes: Master-slave, Lord-servant, Employer-employee. Marx thought we could do one better and maybe have a co-op. It didn’t really have much to do with the big isms of capitalism and communism as much as it had to do with building institutions that bettered our lives through industry. If the people who worked at a firm owned the firm, the firm would be incentivized to do good things for the people who worked for the firm. It’s practically a tautology.

Bell Labs was a private research institute owned by AT&T which had, for many years, a government sanctioned monopoly on the US telephone system. The general goal of Bell Labs was to discover new science and invent new technology that would improve the telephone system. There was this unforeseen side effect: they employed the man, Claude Shannon, who created information theory and the very concept of the digital. What had been signals and waves in a telephone system was transformed into bits and computation on a network. In many ways, Bell Labs brought At&T down because with the concept of the digital, a monopoly on signals and wires no longer mattered. The Internet created  communication of any type, anywhere, by and from anyone to anyone.

Was Bell Labs capitalist? Not really—not in the laissez-faire sense, the all-regulations-off sense. AT&T was *allowed* to be a monopoly in exchange for providing services to the government and a definable benefit the public—better, further phone calls! AT&T certainly wasn’t state-owned. And it wasn’t a co-op. There were stockholders and they made money. But it did have a significant role to play within and for the government. Many Bell Labs employees worked almost exclusively for the government, inventing systems to help the US win World War II, like sonar and radar. Bell Labs was a privately-owned, state-protected, science laboratory that’s main goal was to benefit the public. Quite a socialist outlook really. It’s hard to point to other examples of this in the US right now.

If the frontier of innovation is artificial intelligence and quantum computing and space travel, the US has many privately-owned, state-adverse, private innovation laboratories that benefits the investors. I leave science out of this description because the project of science generally makes its progress known for free. Bell labs often did; look at its treatment of the transistor. It gave the patent away for free. Where would we be today without that choic?

In looking at modern Bell Labs analogs, it’s best to leave out the benefit to the public because even though we all get to use AI (for a price) how it replaces us in the labor market is of no concern to our technology companies. They’ve lost the incentive to care. Our technology companies don’t share their knowledge and they aren’t worried about your dignity or well-being or privacy. Artificial intelligence is likely to replace you and make you poor, quantum computers will destroy any concept of privacy, and a space pilgrimage is highly likely to kill you. Elon can talk about populating Mars all he wants, he has no solution for 38% of Earth’s gravity and its effects on our muscle atrophy, bone density loss, cardiovascular de-conditioning, and balance and coordination issues. He doesn’t care. Move fast and break things. This, I promise you, was never the motto of Bell Labs. Something is amiss.
