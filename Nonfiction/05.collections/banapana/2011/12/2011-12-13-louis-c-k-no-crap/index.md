Artists like \[Radiohead\](http://radiohead.com/), with their digitally distributed and \[variably priced\](http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1666973,00.html) album "In Rainbows," have gotten the gist of direct distribution (or \[disintermediation\](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.09/negroponte\_pr.html) for you nerds\[^1\]) for a few years now. Aside from the movie \[Bubble\](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454792/)---not a \[financial success\](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1153488-bubble/) from what I can tell---I can't think of many disruptive digital distribution events that will be as big as this one. Louis C. K. is letting you buy his latest comedy special \[directly from him\](https://buy.louisck.net/), "No DRM, no regional restrictions, no crap." More awesome words have never existed in a legal statement. I hope this crushes. And if you're like me and don't really think a movie ticket is worth nine bucks, then do like me and buy this twice!

\[^1\]: I say "nerds" lovingly. :)
