In a small but valiant effort to get the \[Skeptic's Dictionary\](http://www.skepdic.com/) higher up in the PageRank system (at Google) I am linking to their entry on \[Deepak Chopra\](http://www.skepdic.com/chopra.html) today. Consider the following statement:

> "Quantum healing is healing the bodymind from a quantum level. That means from a level which is not manifest at a sensory level. Our bodies ultimately are fields of information, intelligence and energy."

I think we all have to look at men and women who make these kinds of (outrageous) claims---who offer no evidence but their own opinions and magical powers---in one of two lights. They are either so arrogant as to believe that their is no virtue in presenting evidence for their claims to fellow humans, \*in which case they think you are an idiot\*. Or they know (or suspect) that they are full of it and they are cynical enough to believe that you will listen to whatever they say, \*in which case they think you are an idiot\*.

You know what? I know you're not an idiot.
