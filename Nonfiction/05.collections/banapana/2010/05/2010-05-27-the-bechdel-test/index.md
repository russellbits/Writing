I can't say that I'm at all shocked by the fact that Hollywood is a male-driven industry or that the content of the movies they make are male-dominated, but I thought that \[more progress than this\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF6sAAMb4s) had been made. I'm not sure how I feel about this with regard to my own work though. On the one hand, \[my novel\](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/carousel-cowboy/1626536) (and several short stories) pass the test. On the other hand, it's much easier to have more characters in general in a novel and also I use the word "whores" a lot.
