Only in this case, the desktop is not a metaphor. Rather, this \[Luxo\](http://www.luxo.com/)-style robotic-arm-projector called \[LuminAR\](http://direct.media.mit.edu/people/natan/current/luminar.html)---why the capital AR and not go whole-hog for Luminarm?---will actually light up your desktop as a screen. Here's a \[video\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5V-dQW8CI). Clearly, the projector needs some more muscle, but just the fact that you can get something like this working in a regular adjustable lamp is intriguing. This is another great example of the fact that augmenting a reality that we are familiar with is a potentially more powerful tool that fully realized virtual environments. One more small step towards \[Second Earth\](http://www.technologyreview.com/infotech/18911/).
