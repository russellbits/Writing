Wow! Banapana is now officially five years old, the \[first post\](http://banapana.com/uncategorized/first-post) (aptly being titled as much) happened on January 13th, 2005. I was stunned at this past New Year's Eve that it was really 2010. 2010 was a year that always lay beyond the horizon of the millennium---it seemed so far away. But here we are. And more laughably, I suppose, I've been \*blogging\* about it all since 2005---not something I would have suspected in 2000 (though I suppose I knew I'd be doing something on the web). This blog has never really been quite what other blogs were (or are). I consider Banpana less of a blog (web log) and more of a repository of editorial pieces (many of them really short). One of these days I'll get around to incorporating \[Delicious\](http://delicious.com) into the site so that I can gather links relevant to the topics here a little more easily... but alas, graduate school will always win the day---as it rightly should. Nonetheless, I think now is the time to set some goals for Banapana for the next year. For one, as I have become more and more immersed in \[Computational Cognitive Science\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_science#Computational\_modeling) I've begun to see more and more conncetions to the things I care about here at Banapana; namely, the effects of media on our thinking. To that extent, one goal I have this year for Banapana is to get a little more concrete about things---to bring to bare some of the cutting-edge science that I read about on a regular basis for research. As an admired alumni said once, "Make it all one thing," and \*that\* is exactly where I would like to drive this operation: toward unison with my graduate work.

So, thanks for reading, and see you soon!
