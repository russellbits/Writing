There is No Science For Learning Styles

You are sure of your learning “style”. Have you stopped to consider what that is? You probably think that you have roughly five or six senses of perception. Ask a good neurologist and you will find that you have something more like 20-35 senses. Are all of these involved in learning. Is it possible that some matrices of these are involved in learning. Whatever the case of that matrix of sensations, there is no scientific evidence that you learn through some particular sensation. No science at all.
