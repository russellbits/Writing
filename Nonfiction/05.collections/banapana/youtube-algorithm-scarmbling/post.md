# Youtube Algorithm Scrambling
## A game because Youtube’s algorithm is dumb and boring.

The Youtube algorithm is stupidly greedy. If you watch just one little UFO video, suddenly your recommendations are inundated with ever more idiotic video that might begin with UFOs but end with alien-government conspiracies. Plus, it completely overwrites any preference you had shown for something else.

Existing Tools and Methods to Influence Recommendations
You can influence your recommendations using the built-in tools:
Marking videos as "Not Interested" or "Don’t Recommend Channel"
Liking, commenting, or subscribing to channels you prefer
Clearing your watch and search history to reset your recommendation profile
Engaging more with content you want to see more of
However, independent investigations have found that these user controls are often ineffective or only partially influence the algorithm, with many users reporting little to no change in their recommendations after using these tools.

So, this is hoe you tune the algorithm by hand. It takes to long to havr a real stering effect on the Toutusb algorithm. So, get an AI agent to do it for you.

1. Go to search
2. Type in some letters
3. Pick whatever video you fancy, you don’t have to care what it is.
4. Key thing: no matter what kind of weird drivel or boring thing you’ve found, like it.
Repeat 2-4

Rmember, you don’t have to watch the video. You just have to *likr* the video in order to scramble the algorithm.

Let me tell you, you are going to find some weird shit.

Accidentally used voice control to go to “explain huggers” instead of “explain algorithms” so tbat waz a fun detour that yieldex this, whatever this is.
I checked out “What if the face hugger attached to Godzilla?” Yes! Finallly the answer to my long sought after question!

OPQ
What ecen is this!? 1 comment but 2.8K views? I couldn’t even get to thenlike button before it was over. 

and a *mind-numbing* video on getting good managerial scores on the opq test. No, I’m sure someone loves this stuff.. It’s been viewed 591 times. Folks, be polite and put descriptions on your videos. Just use chatgpt. You never know who might stumble into this stuff.

Then X. That’s right we’re going OPQX!

Seriously not what Inthought that

Rhen Ingot to thinking: what if I wrote an algorithm or created an AI agent to do this for me? It’d practically randomize the algorithm, although you might steer it in some directions.

So, here you go?

I shoukd xheck out OnDemand and if it’s possible to come up with good business examples, you coukd build these on Upwork.
