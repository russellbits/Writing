Looking for something new? Don't know what's the difference between Prog Rock and Math Rock? Head over to [Epitonic](http://www.epitonic.com) and get some lessons. Of all the sites I've found, Epitonic makes the best effort to explore music and categories and is a great way to get exposure to something new. And if you're looking for the really raw, new stuff, hit [15 Megs of Fame](http://www.15megsoffame.com) -- brought to you by the same deviant geniuses that created [Threadless](http://www.threadless.com)
