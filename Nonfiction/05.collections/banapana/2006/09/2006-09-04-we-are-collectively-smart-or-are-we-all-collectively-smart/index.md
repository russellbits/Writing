A recent [Economist article](http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NSDVQNQ) quoted James Surowiecki of [Wisdom of Crowds](http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/index.html) fame as saying, "With most things, the average is mediocrity. With collective intelligence, it's excellence. You could say it's as if we've been programmed to be collectively smart."¬ù In the right context that statement may seem profound, but from a [neurological point of view](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueron), isn't this stating the obvious? I guess most of us are still a bit [Cartesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_%28philosophy_of_mind%29) in our outlook.
