My spam just keeps getting stranger. And today it got poetic:

"Subject: covered the few enough to assume that we are still: very well, as they course, of health, is Hardin. course, of yourself a Time it was forced to the space!"

I really do think that advertisers, particularly spammers, underestimate the power of human curiosity. Spam is really just so much noise. I'm sure it's sucessful some of the time. But being creative and taking the time to craft something interesting is interesting almost 100% of the time if it shows up in people's email inboxes, you know? Spammers should make more of an effort. That or a very clever artist should take advantage of the gap and generate some spamart.
