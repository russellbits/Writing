Banapana will be slow in the coming weeks, largely because I've decided to test the bounds of my masichistic tendencies. I'm taking what's known as a "Maymester" course here at Clemson. That's a course that would normally be taught in 15 weeks crammed into 14 class periods. Class meetings are 3 hours a pop and meet six days a week. I think I have roughly 1000 pages to read between now and the end of the class two weeks from now. I'm enjoying it though, to be honest. As the prof put it, think of it as a literary boot camp. And besides what beats reading books out in the sun all day (class is in the evening).
