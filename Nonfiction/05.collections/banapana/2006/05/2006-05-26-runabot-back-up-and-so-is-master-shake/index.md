Goodness. [Runabot.com](http://www.runabot.com) is back up after being down for almost a month! So for all you fans of the Master Shake bot that I've been working on, he'd back up! AIM him at _mast3rshak3bot_ Other than that, I've had my head jammed in a bunch of books while I take a literature course during a crazy thing called Maymester here at Clemson. They actually manage to cram a full semester's worth of material into 2 1/2 weeks! There's an insane amount of reading to do and classes are 3 hours long. Hence, zero posting in a while. But no worries my pretties, that all ends soon.
