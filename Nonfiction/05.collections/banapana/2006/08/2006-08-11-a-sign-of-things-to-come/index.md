New York magazine had [this piece](http://newyorkmetro.com/news/people/18842/index.html) on celebrity in New York. There always was an attitude (when I was there) that celebrities were to be left alone. I always thought it was out of respect, but maybe there was an element of "cool" to it--as if you're special because you are in the vicinity of celebrity. Mostly I just didn't care about celebrities and I have no tolerance for people who want to be famous but can't handle the "hastle" of people wanting to talk to you or look at you. But the [Google Map/Celebrity Stalking pages](http://www.gawker.com/stalker/) are really too much. Moreover they're worrisome because of how they illustrate how easily _anyone_ could be tracked if some institution or individual were so inclined. Is this another sign of the [Death of Privacy](http://www.databasenation.com/home.htm)?
