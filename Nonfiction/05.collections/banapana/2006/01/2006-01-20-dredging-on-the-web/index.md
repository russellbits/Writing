Read old stuff can be fun, especially when it's predictive in nature and completely, totally wrong. Witness this diatribe on how to save Apple from Wired in 1997:

[101 Ways to Save Apple](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.06/apple.html)

You know, as a society we spend a lot of time making these kinds of predictions but it seems more rare that we hold people to them. Shouldn't articles and other writing and entertainment concerned with predictions about a new year include all the predictions that never happened? Anyway, my favorite form this article: "Admit it, you're out of the hardware game." Thank the iPod Steve didn't take their advice.
