Yes, faithful readers, yesterday's post was the first one in quite some time. This was largely due to a major life change -- I'm going back to [college](http://www.clemson.edu)! Now that I'm settled it looks like posting to the blog will not only once again be a regular event, it's going to help my sociology grade! I'm going to finish a bachelor of science in economics that I started back before the dot-bomb days. Then, hopefully, it's on to a Ph.D. in cognitive science or artificial intelligence. The real benefit of being out of college and in the rat race for so many years is that college is very fun by comparison.
