This is an update to a post I wrote last year called "[Corporate Media Gets the Game](http://www.banapana.com/culturejamming/corporate-media-gets-the-game)." Long story short, Chevy embraced [Web 2.0](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html) and came out with a [web site](http://chevyapprentice.com/) that allowed everyday folks to create their own Chevy ads. Of course, some people used that as an opportunity to [criticize](http://youtube.com/watch?v=XA6dLFrAFlI&search=chevy%20tahoe) the company. And while many expected Chevy to realize its mistake and take the whole thing down, [they didn't](http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/04/04/the-price-of-converstion-is-worth-it/). Instead, they realized that when you operate in new media [the conversation goes both ways](http://www.cluetrain.com/). The firm gets to advertise to consumers, and consumers get to advertise about the firm. But then I did a Marshall McLuhan take on the whole thing, especially the criticism, and I realized, even though the critical ads are trying to take Chevy down, Chevy's trucks are still impossibly driving to the tops of mountains, aren't they?--proving once again, to the critics' chagrin I'm sure, that the medium is the message (McLuhan 1994).
