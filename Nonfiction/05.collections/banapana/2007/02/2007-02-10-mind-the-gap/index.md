Hey folks. Banapana 2.0 here is undergoing the MOST extensive stylesheet changes that I have yet to attempt to date. Holy cow. I have tried everything from [Glish](http://www.glish.com/css/) to [One True Layout](http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/equalheight) to [Faux Columns](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/) to [Multi-column layouts using over-sized borders and negative margins](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/multicolumnlayouts) and let me tell you something: NONE of them work. I have such a simple vision for the layout of this site, too. It looks like it's going to occur thanks to a combination of the latter two methods. At any rate, for the next several hours (to a day) the site may be doing some wacky things layout-wise. Pay no attention to [the man behind the curtain.](http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/equalheight)
