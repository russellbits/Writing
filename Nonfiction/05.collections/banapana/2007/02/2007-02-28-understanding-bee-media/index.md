It's a fairly well-known bit of \[trivia\](http://www.honey.com/consumers/kids/trivia.asp) that honey bees \[conduct dances\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee\_learning\_and\_communication#Dance\_language) in order to describe the location of a resource to other honey bees. A recent, \[very close-up\](http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000234.g001&representation=PNG\_L) examination of the honey bee's antenna \[has revealed\](http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000234) that bees are uniquely suited to "listen" to the dance of other honey bees, sensing air pressure waves (sound) in the \[250-300 Hz range\](http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/feeling-the-vibes-of-the-waggle-dance/). So my question is this: if the language is not learned (it would appear to be instinctual) does it still constitute a medium?
