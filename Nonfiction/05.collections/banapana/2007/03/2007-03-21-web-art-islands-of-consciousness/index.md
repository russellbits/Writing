Wow. It's been a long time since I've been this impressed with a piece of web art. And maybe the idea of randomly associated sounds and images wouldn't strike anyone as impressive, but after ten trial runs I am continually amazed with how often \[Islands of Consciousness\](http://incubator.quasimondo.com/flash/islands\_of\_consciousness.php) produces something radically relevant. With all of the \[buzz\](http://what.was.the.question.whyblog.org/buzz/) about APIs and Web 2.0 and being able to \[pipe\](http://pipes.yahoo.com) one web site's content into another I certainly hope more artwork like this comes of the shift.
