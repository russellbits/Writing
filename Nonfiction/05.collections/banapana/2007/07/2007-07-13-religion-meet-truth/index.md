Over at \[Stumbleupon\](http://www.stumbleupon.com) (my favorite what-to-do-with-the-web-today site) I ran into an interesting page that did an excellent job of cherry picking sayings and rules from the Old Testament and asking the logical question "\[Why Can't I Own a Canadian?\](http://www.humanistsofutah.org/2002/WhyCantIOwnACanadian\_10-02.html)" Why, indeed? Still, as reasonable as it is for someone to attempt to tear apart a set of old and orally handed down series of stories in order to show that it is something other than the "word of god," there were many who came to the defense of, in this case Christianity. Many of them argued that, of course those old books in the Bible are wrong. We know now, from the new testament, that there is a \*new\* way---without seeming to miss the subjective nature that time grants their beliefs. I mean, after all, Mohammad \[came along quite a while after Christ\](http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/examples/religions/religions.html), I suppose we should really all think that he is correct by that logic.

In response to that notion, and the notion that any religious creed or text is absolute, I say this: The inconsistencies of religious texts (all of them) are due to changing human opinions and moral codes---needs that existed at the time of their doctrines. The only consistent law that man has yet to uncover is that law which is communicated to him through nature's total and utter consistency. Through experiment, time, and a gathering of evidence and proof in replication, you can approach truth. No single human can have it or tell it to you. You must learn it. Religion wants to give it to you easy---"just obey these rules," they say. Christ, Buddha, all great religious leaders, \*and\* Science want you to work hard at it, study it, and learn it for yourself. That is the only path to truth.
