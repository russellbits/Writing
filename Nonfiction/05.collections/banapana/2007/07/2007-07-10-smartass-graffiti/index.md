I love smart-ass graffiti. Stuff that's just artistic is great, but the good stuff (to me) says something. It's why \[Banksy\](http://www.banksy.co.uk/) remains number 1 on my list of favorite visual artists. I even jot down good stuff that I see in bathrooms like "Jesus Saves!" and written underneath "At the Chase Manhattan Bank!". Good stuff. So today, I'm sending you over to Cool Stuff 4U to look at some \[great photos of smart-ass graffiti\](http://indianspencer.blogspot.com/2007/07/owned-by-grafiti.html).
