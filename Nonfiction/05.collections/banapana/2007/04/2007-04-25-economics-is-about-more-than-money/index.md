I've recently completed and posted an essay on \[linguistic binds in economics\](http://www.banapana.com/potential-linguistic-binds-in-economics/1/). The short version is that utility, a foundational concept in economics, is problematic. And it has helped to steer economics in a direction that is primarily concerned with the maximization of production and profit--a problematic goal in a world that is going to need a lot more \[sustainability\](http://www.banapana.com/economics/a-ways-to-go-to-cradle-to-cradle).

One of the things that I am trying to dig at with this essay is that neoclassical economics has done a poor job of creating a model for economies that can deal with different sets of property rights and modes of distribution—models like \[open source software\](http://www.opensource.org/). Appropriately enough, I found a post at \[a post at gapingvoid\](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable\_Type/archives/003872.html) that asks the seemingly innocuous question "Where are all the open source billionaires?" I also found a post by Coding Horror that provides a thoughtful and cogent \[rebuttal\](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000842.html)—a rebuttal that includes the idea that a lot of open source programmers are not entirely driven by a profit motive. This "programmer altruism" has been thoroughly \[dissected\](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/1503.html) elsewhere; although I would still argue that these analyses are missing the point. There are some economies (and markets) that don't deal with money—believe it or not. Especially where commodities are non-scarce; an idea in economics that has really yet to take hold.
