Anyone who even occasionally watches [the Colbert Report](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml) on [Comedy Central](http://www.comedycentral.com/) will know that Colbert likes to mess with [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) on occasion. He once encouraged his audience to change the entry on [elephants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elephant) so that they weren't going extinct. It worked. Not in the sense that the elephants were actually saved, but that the entry said so for quite a while.

This past Monday night Steven decided it was time to attack "Reality" entry on Wikipedia, and urged his viewers to change it so that it read "Reality is a commodity." So I went and checked out the entry for "Reality" on Wikipedia. It had been protected just a little bit after the Colbert show aired (Looks like it was changed at 4:40 in the morning somehwere!) But at any rate, the action taken to stop the vandalism created this amazing little statement in the page history:

> (Protected Reality: Colbert mention \[edit=sysop:move=sysop\] (expires 07:40, January 30, 2007 (UTC)))

It's good to know that reality is protected. Although, I do think that [Reality will have to start advertising soon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG).

Also, I've been reading a lot of Philip K. Dick lately and was pleased to discover that the Reality entry has this gem by him:

> Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.
