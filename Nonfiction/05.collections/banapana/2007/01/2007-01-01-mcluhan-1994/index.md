McLuhan, Marshall \*Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man\* The MIT Press: Boston, MA, 1994 (Reprint Edition)

From the Back Cover : This reissue of Understanding Media marks the thirtieth anniversary (1964-1994) of Marshall McLuhan's classic expose on the state of the then emerging phenomenon of mass media. Terms and phrases such as "the global village" and "the medium is the message" are now part of the lexicon, and McLuhan's theories continue to challenge our sensibilities and our assumptions about how and what we communicate.
