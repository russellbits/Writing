Among other things, the \[widely\](http://gothamist.com/2007/10/10/jonny\_greenwood.php) \[talked about\](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/10785-in-rainbows/) independent and \[variably priced\](http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1666973,00.html) Radiohead release of "\[In Rainbows\](http://www.inrainbows.com)" seems to have cracked people's heads open just a bit more with regards to what is really possible with digital distribution. Moreover, two other developments, though smaller in scale, have also caught my attention: \[Tunecore\](http://www.tunecore.com/) and \[B.R.T.C.\](http://bumrushthecharts.blogspot.com/) Tunecore is a remarkably simple iTunes publishing site; so that even without a label, truly independent musicians can get their work up on iTunes, get their own royalties, and keep their copyrights. This is for musicians what \[Lulu\](disintermediation/in-response-to-podymouth) is for writers; that is to say: DIY. B.R.T.C. (Bum Rush the Charts) is a grassroots movement that is attempting to influence iTunes charts by getting mass numbers of people to buy some particular song.

Predictably, when asked about the movement:

Hey, Mr. Hogarth, here's a few line from Spoon's "The Underdog" that you should think about: "You got no time for the messenger / got no regard for the thing that you don't understand / you got no fear of the underdog / that's why you will not survive!"
