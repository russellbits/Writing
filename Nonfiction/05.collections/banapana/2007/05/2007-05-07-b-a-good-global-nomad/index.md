My friend, Jill Woodward, over at the \[bgood fashion blog\](http://blog.b-goodfashion.com/) recently wrote a post titled "\[Global Nomads\](http://blog.b-goodfashion.com/global-nomads/)" in which she talks about having friends in far off places and still being able to maintain good friendships in the digital age. I can't definitely appreciate that point of view. When I left New York nigh on a year ago I was worried about losing touch with people but that really hasn't proven to be the case. Between my \[last.fm page\](http://www.last.fm/user/ruzel/), my \[flickr page\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/troped/), \[friendster\](http://www.friendster.com/russorama) and \[facebook\]() and blogging in general, I've been able to keep up with most everyone most of the time. It's been especially nice being able to keep tabs on \[my sister\](http://maepresss.blogspot.com/). I like the idea of Global Nomads. Why settle down anywhere when you can be everywhere?
