On may 11th, I (finally) finished up a bachelor of science in economics that I had postponed back in 1997! You can check out a few photos of the \[official event\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/troped/sets/72157600228796112/) here. I never ever planned on graduating from \[Clemson University\](http://www.clemson.edu). I grew up in the vicinity of that institution and some rebellious teenage instinct kept me from ever considering it a place to attend. But I have to say that in the last year and a half I found a new appreciation for both the University and the students there. Clemson has made a \[serious endeavor\](http://cworld.clemson.edu/winter2002/1.htm) to become a nationally ranked top 20 public university and with all the activity there, it really looks like they could pull it off. I have been especially impressed with the efforts of the current president \[Jim Barker\](http://www.clemson.edu/newsroom/articles/top-stories/Campus\_Development\_Plan.php5). I wish them the best of luck! But one of the nice things about graduating from the University where your father teaches mathematics (aside from lots of free lunches) is the \[hug you get\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/troped/503510030/in/set-72157600228796112/)at the end of the graduation line. So, at least now, some of the posts you read here about \[economics\](http://www.banapana.com/economics) will have slightly more validity!
