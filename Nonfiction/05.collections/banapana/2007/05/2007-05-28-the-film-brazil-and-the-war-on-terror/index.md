I've written here before about how artists, cognizant of and attuned to the patterns of culture can \[sometimes seem prescient\](http://www.banapana.com/culturejamming/are-artists-prescient). The film Brazil has turned out to be another fantastic example of this. Robert Blumen has a \[great analysis\](http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig3/blumen3.html) of the eerie similarities between the 15-year-old film and this nation's (the US) current state of affairs.
