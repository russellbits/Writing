No doubt about it, whether you love or hate Steve Jobs, you have to admit he's an interesting character. I found this \[really nice read\](http://nymag.com/news/features/33524/) over at New York Magazine. Normally I wouldn't post something like this to Banapana, but with all the iPhone hype, it's nice to see something about Apple that has some substance. And if you want something with less substance (but good anecdotes straight from the horse's mouth) you should check out the Apple \[Folklore site\](http://www.folklore.org/index.py).
