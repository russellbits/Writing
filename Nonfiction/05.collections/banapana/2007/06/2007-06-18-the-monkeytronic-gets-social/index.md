Well, my favorite surrealist web site \[The Monkeytronic Circus of Conquest\](http://www.monkeytroniccircusofconquest.com) got a little more interactive today. It looks like the pages where characters \[chat about the work\](http://www.monkeytroniccircusofconquest.com/because/you-cant-have-it-if-you-dont-know-what-it-is) are now open to the public for commentary. And I also noticed that the M.C.O.C has gotten itself a \[twitter account\](http://www.twitter.com/belovedleader). And, as if all that fun were not enough, the site is now producing \[an RSS feed\](http://www.monkeytroniccircusofconquest.com/feed/) too! Awesome, now I can get nonsense sent to me constantly"â€œas if I didn't already have enough to distract me.
