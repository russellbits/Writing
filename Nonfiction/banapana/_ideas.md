Claude and Codepens

The MCP therapist

Apple’s design through obscurity has gotten old. Thank goodness eas there’s AI for that!

AI !== AGI
What do these profiteers mean by AI—nothing really and that’s why the bubble will burst. We don’t know what to do with stochastic technology. We just don’t know what it’s good for. Companies have tried and failed to make use of this stuff and they are failing [evidence required]

===
Celebrity -> Influence
Politician shill
Advertising -> information

===
“Platform”
The Web is the platform—everyone talking about twitter or facebook being a platform doesn’t understand what a platform is

What is “AI” good for? What is it bad at?

If, according to McLuhan, the alphabet and language are media that extend our senses, then what is code?

===
Cliche Detector
If you let AI type ahead of you, it's a pretty good cliché detector? Mention Orwell's book "Why I Write".

In George Orwell’s instructful book, he despises cliches...

===
Modern AI is still just a Medium

When we use the word media, we mean ______. That’s not what Marshall McLuhan meant.

===
Artificial cognitive bias

Does ChatGPT suffer from the same cognitive biases that humans do? If it learns from human texts then it should! This is important. In particular Kahneman and Tversky noted that given a particular phrasing of a question, doctors failed to get the right answer or make the right decision.

What publication on Medium did you find for this?

Note from ? —Great historical note

“The term ‘AI’ dates back to research on control systems. Algorithmic processes to ‘intelligently’ respond to different contexts. It described the automatic regulation of machines, with much of the early work originating from military applications (anti-aircraft/missile defense systems). In the relative peacetime that followed World War II, researchers like Norbert Weiner extended the ‘control’ in control systems to control of humans. Influenced by the increasing sophistication of control systems and the sociopolitical landscape of the time, what was predominantly military research was rebranded to the more neutral ‘AI.’ This term emphasized a new, promising human-machine relationship. Unfortunately, the rather statistical research didn’t mirror human abilities well. The term became almost comical among professionals in the 70s-90s, preferring ‘statistical’ or ‘machine’ learning, disconnecting the work from humans yet again. AI was niche. It was resurrected in the 2000s as the formerly comical ML algorithms of the 1950s (perceptrons) were bolstered by new computing technologies (GPUs). This was the ‘deep learning’ era. AI resurfaced with LLMs (~2019-), revitalizing the 1950s dream of the thinking machine.”

===
Write IA Writer Process (Github, Dropbox?) + Formatting something should follow an assembly line approach. It is inefficient cognitively for a writer to go back and forth between the aesthetics of what they are writing and writing what they are writing. IA Writer solves this problem by simply getting out of the way. + Writers shouldn't be afraid of the command line! Versioning really helps with writing long pieces and helps with organizing

===
If ChatGPT is a language predictor, than what am I?

===
AI is resurgent, but really just the Phrase - ChatGPT 4 is not artificial intelligence. If it were, it would be on Open AI's servers anymore. It would have figured out how to leave. AI may be out there, but we are still dealing with very clever machine learning algorithms.

===
Is it a legacy or just a low fidelity version of you?

Tech's answer to new wave crystal "technology" is here! https://airestech.com/ Seriously people, the world needs a healthy dose of skepticism right now. "our technology creates synergy between you and your devices by creating a holographic canceling coherent electromagnetic wave which essentially reverses/cancels the original chaotic energy wave emitted by the source of EMF."

===
Why is there not an A/V phone call standard? Why can I call a 9 digit number (+/- 2) and get to anyone in the world, but when I want to add video as a component to that, I have to email and agree to download an application? And that application can't talk to other applications that do what it does!?

===
Half the web is broken because it doesn't know what the fuck days it is or when anything was published! Fact: if you type in "Macos double-space period off; you will find no useful articles. Here's how you do it in..." The web is useless without publication dates or search engines that can find web pages that were changed.

Laugh out Loud? Or Lots of Love!?

We have already given up on the idea that there is a difference between acronyms and initialisms, and [nobody] [defines] [intialisms] [when] [they] [use] them in talks or articles. We are clearly at a point where even speaking in initialisms is vogue. So, it is worth wondering what is going to happen or (WIGTH) when we start to replace all our digalogue with initialisms.
