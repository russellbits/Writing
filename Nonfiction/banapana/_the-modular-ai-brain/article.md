The Modular Human Intelligence

The human brain has module that specialize in things like recognizing faces or cars. AI is going to require that; LLMs can’t cut it.

Note how the biology of the brain is modular. You can change your personality by physically changing your brain.

There's actually no reason to think that the biological neural networks in our brains aren't using higher dimensional maps and something akin to latent space. What the brain function produces, i.e. your consciousness, that process has a hard time conceiving of higher dimensional space, but that doesn't mean the underlying cells and networks of neurons don't use them. Consider memory. Last night at dinner I could not remember an author's name. By the end of the dinner, I had it. What took so long? I don't know but it's proof that there are background processes in our brain that we are not privy to—just like ChatGPT!

When you think about it, the current crop of AI apps are more like modules for us.

Current AI is stochastic and to be of use needs to be able to access deterministic channels (RAG and MCP) and for *approval* they need to be able to check in with people *a lot*. This puts us more in the position of being a Sheppard for AI, or more reasonably a more hybrid human.
