US Totalitarianism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt

Hannah Arendt argues that for Totalitarianism to exist, there must be "a dynamic of isolation and loneliness" amongst the public.

"What prepares men for totalitarian domination in the non-totalitarian world is the fact that loneliness, once a borderline experience usually suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age, has become an everyday experience of the ever-growing masses of our century."

A free market does not enforce the best idea the same way that evolution does.
