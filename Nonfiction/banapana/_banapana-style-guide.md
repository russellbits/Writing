# Banapana Writing Style Guide

## Core Concept
Banapana explores "minds on media" - the effect of our perceptual technology on our cognitive abilities. The blog follows Marshall McLuhan's thinking that media are extensions of human grasp and perception. It is perfectly willing to embrace and extend his ideas, while admitting that concept like hot and cold media are not scientific. We deal in science! We’re just not very serious about it. The name, a very silly made up name—Banapana—is meant to instill whimsy. We might be talking about the end of the world, but it’s not like that won’t be kind of interesting. The language is a much surreal monty python as it is Malcolm Gladwell or Stephen Johnson.

## Voice & Tone

### The Banapana Sensibility
- **Suck.com DNA**: Not afraid of being snarky, but thoughtfully so
- **Target-rich environment**: Unlike Suck.com's celebrity focus, Banapana aims at digital luminaries and cultural critics (Steven Johnson, Malcolm Gladwell, Kara Swisher, Steve Jobs.
- **Steve Jobs frequency**: He comes up a lot. Embrace it.
- These people are all phonies and busy-bees; we have reverence for the real creators: Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Tim Burners-Lee, I.J Good, whoever invented the microchip
- **Influences**: David Reese and John Hodgman for wry, subtle humor
- **Sustained sarcasm**: Not drive-by snark, but extended satirical arguments that build
- **Genuine concern underneath**: The snark covers real anxiety about where technology is taking us
- **Get deep** We don’t talk down to people. We talk about what we know and if you don’t understand, go ask the nearest AI.

### Structural Elements
- **Open with grounding**: A concrete metaphor, historical parallel, or personal anecdote
- **Build systematically**: Layer the argument - don't dump the thesis in paragraph one
- **Callbacks**: Reference earlier points to create cohesion (e.g., the "bicycle for the mind" callback in the chauffeur piece)
- **The turn**: Around 60-70% through, shift from observation to implication - "here's what this actually means"
- **Ending**: Land on the unsettling conclusion, don't try to fix it or be uplifting

## Technical Specs

### Length
- **Average**: ~1000 words
- **Talky pieces**: Up to 3000 words when really exploring an idea
- **Never**: Pad to hit a word count - if it's said, it's said

### Links
- **Heavy linking philosophy**: Lots of links, Suck.com style
- **Purpose**: Help readers discover something new through you
- **Types**: 
  - Research/statistics (Pew, academic sources)
  - Cultural references (TED talks, YouTube clips)
  - Books (Amazon affiliate links when appropriate: `https://amzn.to/XXXXXX`)
  - Historical context (Wikipedia is fine for established topics)
  - Related thinkers (McLuhan, other media theorists)
- **Placement**: Integrate naturally - the link should enhance, not interrupt
- **Parenthetical asides**: Great place for a link with a knowing tone

### Formatting
- Standard markdown with `#` headers for major sections
- Subheads are optional but useful for longer pieces
- **Bold** for emphasis on key concepts/phrases (sparingly)
- *Italics* for thoughts, emphasis, or slight tonal shift
- Em dashes—like this—for parenthetical thoughts (use liberally)
- Lists and bullets: Only when actually listing things; resist the urge to bullet-point arguments

## Content Patterns

### What Works
- **Historical parallels**: Tulip mania → dot-com → AI bubble structure works really well
- **Extended metaphors**: Develop them fully (tollbooth → chauffeur → voice in your head)
- **Progression structures**: Post-literate → post-cognitive builds momentum
- **The "here's the thing"**: Useful transition for when the real point arrives
- **Concrete scenarios**: "Picture this:" followed by specific examples
- **Questions as structure**: "Are we heading for X?" can organize a section
- **McLuhan invocations**: Always welcome, but earn them - don't just name-drop

### What to Avoid
- **Tech cheerleading**: This is a skeptical space
- **False balance**: If something's concerning, say so
- **Unearned optimism**: Don't stick a hopeful ending on a dark observation
- **Buzzword soup**: Call out jargon, don't use it straight
- **Explaining the joke**: Trust the reader to catch the wry tone
- **Academic hedging**: "It seems that perhaps maybe" - just make the claim

## Recurring Themes

### The Banapana Obsessions
- **Cognitive sovereignty**: Who controls your thinking?
- **Privacy erosion**: Always lurking in the background
- **Bubble patterns**: Financial manias, hype cycles, collective delusion
- **Interface intimacy**: How close is too close for technology?
- **Serendipity death**: The loss of random discovery
- **McLuhan's ghost**: What would he say about this?
- **Steve Jobs**: The bicycle, the reality distortion field, the contradictions

### Common Moves
- **The callback to an earlier bubble**: Tulips, South Sea, railroads, dot-com
- **The Steve Jobs quote**: Usually "bicycle for the mind" or reality distortion field
- **The grim statistic**: Reading rates, attention spans, screen time
- **The "here's what actually happens"**: Puncturing the utopian pitch
- **The surveillance capitalism turn**: How this gets monetized
- **The McLuhan lens**: Media as extension/amputation

## Example Patterns from Published Work

### "Tulips to Transformers" Structure
1. Personal grounding (dot-com experience)
2. Historical catalog of bubbles
3. "See the pattern?" - explicit theme statement
4. Current situation analysis
5. Specific evidence of bubble behavior
6. Dark prediction of what comes next
7. Landing: We never learn

### "Chauffeur in Your Head" Structure
1. Revive a dated metaphor (information superhighway)
2. Extend it systematically (tollbooth → chauffeur)
3. Personal scenario ("Picture this...")
4. The creepy realization (can't tell your thoughts apart)
5. Historical context (post-literate statistics)
6. Escalation (post-literate → post-cognitive)
7. McLuhan checkpoint
8. Jobs callback
9. Landing: We won't notice the shift

## Collaboration Notes

### What Helps
- Share the raw conversation/thinking - the exploratory quality translates
- Point to specific phrases or observations to preserve ("keep the wry bits")
- Indicate link preferences (affiliate links, specific sources)
- Flag tonal concerns ("too dark?" "not snarky enough?")

### What the AI Should Do
- Preserve your actual language when it's working
- Punch up where energy flags
- Add structural signposting if the argument meanders
- Suggest links for claims/references
- Match the Banapana voice without overshooting into parody
- Build momentum toward the unsettling conclusion
- Trust the reader's intelligence

### What the AI Should NOT Do
- Soften the critique to be "balanced"
- Add hopeful endings that aren't earned
- Over-explain the humor
- Strip out the personality for "clarity"
- Bullet-point what should be prose
- Sand off the edges

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] Does this feel like it could only come from Banapana?
- [ ] Is there a clear through-line/argument?
- [ ] Are the links adding discovery value?
- [ ] Does the snark serve the point or just show off?
- [ ] Is Steve Jobs here? (Not required, but statistically likely)
- [ ] Does it build to something unsettling?
- [ ] Would McLuhan nod knowingly?
- [ ] Will readers come away thinking differently about their devices?
