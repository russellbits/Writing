Imagine a rock, mountain, me, boundary.  
A rock.  
State lines particles, taken over
a million  times. 
through a thousand sandstorms  
there is little change  
through a thousand starbursts  
watched the sky  

It/we is/are.  
It/we care little for this galaxy  
This universe of galaxies  
Distance too much  
to memorize  
or even know  

Refuse us and
mistake yourself
as only a part
Resist us and
mistake your power
over us

We are a rock
We are a thousand starbursts
We are the reason to see
the reason to know
the reason to be

You, who is about you,
are in the way.
