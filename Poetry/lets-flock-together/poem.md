# Let's Flock Together

Pretty birds are always out of reach
on approach, they can fly
& if you are unwanted company
their colors go,
the brightness over you
Leaves you still wanting to be close

My colors, my auras, 
They're all right.
My dreams, they make sense
when my cockatiel explains them.
Standing next to her,
it seems a good idea
to flock.

That one branch we share,
when she stands
next to me, À côté de moi,
the day surely looks better.
Shoulder to shoulder makes a good
looking out, the world hopeful &
easier to balance.

And then she brings me nice things, too?
Voila! Amazing. Sparkles.
So,

Daydreams ahead,
we can navigate the sky,
using our pretty eyes
to find the horizon that could
be best—ha ha ! 
See what I did there, Bliss?
Sparkles?
Laughter?
(Sometimes I'm just pretty.)

The truth is,
It's boring when you fly a long way.
You need a mate
And a laugh
I'm good for that.
I know you are too
Let's fly a long way together
And have that.
