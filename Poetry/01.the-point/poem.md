# The Point
Work hard
Be nice
Seek novelty
before enlightenment
chop wood
carry water
after enlightenment
chop wood
carry water

All of this told to me by
old dead men
Hurry, hurry,
Facebook, Twitter, Zing,
The attention becomes
Wild, fractal, impossible to track
Like the deep ocean waters
where there is no light anymore
But the creatures there don’t know
It’s absence

You know what I want to be when I grow up?
Dead.
And yet still speaking
Like the old ones that spoke
in a ghostly way
Through ages
To me

before enlightenment
chop wood
carry water
after enlightenment
chop wood
carry water
