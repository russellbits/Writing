They were little hopes and confidences.   
They were gold-lit secrets hidden beneath bridges under   bridges, where she came to him—already two months gone—  
to see how he was getting on  
to see where she used to sit  
in the shadow of the bottom corner of his lip  

His brown eyes stray from shoe to shoe Himself hidden in his pockets, he keeps from view  
of the bridge's rumbling  
as the F clacks by  
drowning out the Autumn in her sigh  
the air so cool and crisp keeps  
their dearest words in silence  

like the little hopes and confidences  
their love in nooks so tucked in their hearts  
where  
he's a passage now and leaving  
she is twenty minutes away from home  
though present,  
they're done, already gone  
she wonders what he'll do alone  
he wonders where she'd gone

just before she steps and lightly falls a bit  
into his arms from beyond that rift  
by the cold river  
she quiet slips around his middle. 
softly enwrapped, there 
he misses her a little 

embraced they are like bridges beneath bridges  
between the walls and alleys where their love is hid
