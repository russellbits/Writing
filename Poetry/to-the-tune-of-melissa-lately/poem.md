Casually I
  think I spy
    worth a try
A girl in a black dress
Silhouhette in red light
Belying this, a moody mnight
Something new seems just right
a girl in a black dress

Question her
  with no concern/consent
    expecting no on descent
But she defies
  hears no lies
    what surprise
to me

And again i think the world framed
in a fuzzy pane
with no threat lurking
  nothing but just talking
With this girl in a black dress

sit a while
  to digress
    perhaps transgress

From this, two mortal coils
spiral
Speak just senseless
  for a while
Spin in the moment
With this girl in a black dress

The night is young
But ages fast
Weary friends have to pass
And I move on
  trod on
    go along
From Melissa now,
  in her black dress
