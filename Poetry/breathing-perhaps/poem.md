Breathing Perhaps

schuuuuuuwap

PERHAPS the power of these hive bodies
of ours,
trillions of pulsating globules
with built-in software that keeps copying us over and over an dover andveroen and ovvver
SHAP SERP
PERHAPS the power in that gathering herd
Is the ability to breathe and flex
And in doing so change slightly the Universe

in which we are utterly trapped             ratpped...?

SPERHAP

Like the heart muscle			in everyone, ever
Each heart comes and goes
like fruit on a biological vine
buds, grows, is consumed, buried, or rots
All of them
All of Us

Every heart ever

PERHAPS we could negotiate a way to share the world
Hearts on a wall, each one executed
We can't be such terrible copiesWe can't be such terrible copies
We can't terriblebe such  copies
can'tcopiWe terriblebe such  es!
such  epiWe terribs!can'tcopiWe terrib

But like a heart muscle
Perhaps
We pulse and our inflections
Change everythingChange everythingCha
ChanChange everything
