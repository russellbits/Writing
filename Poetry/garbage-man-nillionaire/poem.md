Flat and tired lay you down
Sun through a pick-up truck window
Hide beneath that baseball sky
Watch your only hour fly
Sleep and dream of baseball cards
Made you a millionaire they could
But the vision addressed
They could not profess
15 cents was worth a lifetime
And garbage now you know
It's what you collect
And other boy's wasted treasures.
