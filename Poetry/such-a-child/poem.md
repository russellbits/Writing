"Such A Child"

In a place I do not know  
My mind stretched out on a canopy  
The familiar put on the wrong  
continent, which no longer  
matters on this blue dot  

Masses of us moving, trying
To get to a place, un lieu
Where we might articulate
Culture, collective thoughts
Any sense of home

But the waves, the Truth
Washes
And then the mass of us
Takes the place
And it starts all over again

I'd like to see you
In a cosmic way, old friend
When the world was just
And I know it never used to be
But can I go anyway?
