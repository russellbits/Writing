She sows herself in every
Posse
in deputies
that you cannot be in,
Dean, deacon, demon,
The church is still missing
Her plume
I’ve often thought about 
How far do go we?

That the legend was untrue.

I know what you are;
I’ve Always known your secret.
The melody is always obvious, sweetness:
I can hear the melody from Montreal to New York to Sydney,

What a sight, you are
From one bay to another
Pacific to Atlantic
I know your song
I like it
If you don’t mind
I’ll sing along
