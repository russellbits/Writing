Of the maze and the hedges  
There are hedgehogs and foxes  
The hedgehogs each know a big thing  
know it well and complete  
But the foxes—dart about  
Running the maze like a game  
They know many things,  
Though none big and none complete  

Once, a bold young fox pushed through  
a muse in the hedge; bored with the maze  
he'd run so many times  
And went to explore the woods  
The sunbeams, the dark shadows  
All new and fascinating to him  

Where the maze was predictable  
The woods were not
could grow cold and dark  
And the fox while clever  
With his white and orange coat  
got scratched and hurt
His fur knotted, soiled, damp    
And more than a few times he bled.

Still,
The fox pushed on,
further in to the woods  
Not fearful—for the woods  
still had more to show him.
There were miracles
like snowfalls in which
He danced  
Moutaintops of granite on which  
He pranced  
Waterfalls that towered  
He studied  
Calming crick whirlpools that   
He embodied  

Still,  
The fox grew weary, wary, and tired  
On his very long journey  
And finally came to  
A far away and high place  
Named "Angel's Rest"  
Where the fox could be alone  
And slumber in the Sun.
Clouds and sunbeams, his ceiling  
The fox slept hard  
and free from nightmares  
Of the woods and the dark.

And of the woods, you should know,
There are nymphs.
And they care deeply for the world.  
Among pixies who trick and prank,
Elves who could care less,
Fairies who dislike you,
The wood nymph  
Loves the woods and  
And all the creatures in it.

There was one...
A creature of such laughter
with bright blue eyes she could
change the weather.
& she knew the paths through the roots
even when she let it rain
because the trees wanted it.
She'd laugh to herself, wet & muddy

Dancing on air
she tripped and loved the colors
all the little flowers for
It was her design, her manifest
To make sure the glory of creation
should be looked after;
Even pushed a bit

She came up a slumbering fox
She set to cleaning and combing  
His coat, salving his wounds  
She knew it was all right  
Because the fox smiled in his sleep  
Right there on Angel's Rest.

As she gently groomed him, his Orange. 
returned and she began to idly  
speak to him  
She spoke of making  
And doing amazing things  
She spoke of dance  
And the conversation in   
the woods that no one  
seems to hear anymore  
She spoke of healing  
And how worried she was about  
The world and her woods  

The fox, one-eye open  
Lay listening to the nymph  
And smiled 'till his white fangs  
Shown—amused at this nymph  
Talking at a clip and all to herself  
He wagged his tail a little  

For the fox was fascinated  
Because the maze had become so boring  
And the woods so dark and cold  
And the wood nymph knew new things  
And the wood nymph gave the fox 
Butterflies  
And the fox, having forgotten  
That butterflies were possible  
Awoke, renewed. 

Upon his awakening,  
the pair played a new game  
that the wood nymph had invented  
Called "hide and seek"
They played for days and miles  
And every time they found each other  
Each would tackle the other  
They'd laugh and howl and hoot  
And roll around atop the roots  
Of the woods  
And the woods would smile.



One day, the nymph bade the fox to sit a spell  
And she told him of a dire mission  
She had to leave, and with good reason  
but could he wait?  
For her?  
The fox gave a solemn nod &
Lay down in a mossy spot in the Spring Sun  
And waited  

He awoke from his nap  
Rolled a bit in the moss  
Panted, waited  
And waited and he waited some more  
Until his sunlit grove grew boring  
And he so hated boredom  

It began to get cold again  
And the fox thought many things  
He thought of the maze  
Perhaps returning  
He thought of finding waterfalls  
He thought of jumping off them.
He thought too much  
And knew he must move, not think  
And so off he trot 
in to the woods  
And away from Angel's Rest  

It was many moons he wandered  
Content to be alone  
And many things he discovered  
His many things known  
None big, none complete  

Until that one morning  
He sensed that the woods were smiling  
And he knew why  
For not knowing big things  
and none complete  
He knew  
That she was near  
And when he ran to find her  
She jumped out of the brush  
And tackled him  
And they laughed and howled and hooted  
And rolled around atop the roots  
Of the woods  
And the woods smiled.



These days,  
The wood nymph and the fox wander  
The woods together  
They each have missions:  
The fox to discover,  
The nymph to protect.  
They wander sometimes apart  
But the paths of the woods are funny,  
strange and unpredictable &  
Even have their own desires  
Because they twist, bend and grow such that  
The fox and nymph keep finding  
each other  

And the woods sigh  
When the footsteps of the two  
Are together
