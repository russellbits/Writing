Of the maze and the hedges  
There are hedgehogs and foxes  
The hedgehogs each know a big thing  
know it well and complete  
But the foxes—darting about  
Running the maze like a game  
know many things,  
Though none big and none complete  

Once, a bold young fox pushed through  
a muse in the hedges; bored with the maze  
he'd run so many times  
And went to explore the woods  
The sunbeams and the dark shadows  
All new and fascinating to him  

But where the maze was predictable  
The woods were dangerous and  
could grow cold and dark  
And though the fox was clever  
His white and orange coat  
became knotted, soiled, damp  
The woods scratched and hurt  
And more than a few times he bled  

The fox pushed on, further in to the woods  
Never fearful—for the woods  
still had more to show him  
Miracles like snowfalls in which  
He danced  
Moutaintops of granite on which  
He pranced  
Waterfalls that towered  
He studied  
Calming crick whirlpools that   
He embodied  

Still,  
The fox grew weary, wary, and tired  
On his very long journey  
And finally came to  
A far away and high place  
Named "Angel's Rest"  
Where the fox could be alone  
And slumber in the Sun  
Near him, the world Laid out  
Clouds and sunbeams, his ceiling  
On that overlook of a great river  
The fox slept hard  
and free from nightmares  
Of the woods and the dark  
Of the world beneath  

And of the woods  
There are nymphs  
And they care deeply for the world  
Among pixies who trick and prank  
The wood nymph  
Loves the woods and  
All the creatures in it  

And as the fox slumbered  
A wood nymph came upon him  
She set upon cleaning and combing  
His coat, salving his wounds  
She knew it was all right  
Because the fox smiled in his sleep  

As she gently groomed him, his Orange. 
returned and she began to idly  
speak to him  
She spoke of making  
And doing amazing things  
She spoke of dance  
And the conversation in   
the woods that no one  
seems to hear anymore  
She spoke of healing  
And how worried she was about  
The world and her woods  

The fox, one-eye open  
Lay listening to the nymph  
And smiled 'till his white fangs  
Shown, amused at this nymph  
Talking at a clip and all to herself  
He wagged his tail a little  

For the fox was fascinated  
Because the maze had become so boring  
And the woods so dark and cold  
And the wood nymph knew new things  
And the wood nymph gave the fox  
Butterflies  
And the fox, having forgotten  
That butterflies were possible  
Awoke, renewed. 

Upon his awakening,  
the pair played a new game  
The wood nymph had invented  
Called hide and seek  
They played for days and miles  
And every time they found each other  
Each would tackle the other  
And laugh and howl and hoot  
And roll around atop the roots  
Of the woods  
And the woods would smile  

One day, the nymph bade the fox to sit a spell  
And she told him of a dire mission  
She had to leave, and with good reason  
She must leave, but could the fox wait?  
For her?  
The fox gave a solemn nod and  
Lay down in a mossy spot in the Spring Sun  
And waited  

He awoke from his nap  
Rolled a bit in the moss  
Panted and waited  
And waited and he waited more  
Until his sunlit grove grew boring  
And he so hated boredom  
But still he waited  

It began to get cold again  
And the fox thought many things  
He thought of the maze  
And perhaps returning  
He thought of finding waterfalls  
He thought of jumping off them  
But eventually,  
He thought too much  
And knew he must move, not think  
And so off he trotted, back  
in to the woods  
And away from Angel's Rest  

It was many moons he wandered  
Content to be alone  
And many things he discovered  
His many things known  
None big, and none complete  

Until one morning  
He sensed that the woods were  
smiling  
And he knew why  
For not knowing big things  
and none complete  
He knew  
That she was near  
And when he ran to find her  
She jumped out of the brush  
And tackled him  
And they laughed and howled and hooted  
And rolled around atop the roots  
Of the woods  
And the woods smiled

These days,  
The wood nymph and the fox wander  
The woods together  
They each have missions:  
The fox to discover,  
The nymph to protect.  
They wander sometimes apart  
But the paths of the woods are funny,  
strange and unpredictable and  
Even have their own desires  
Because they twist, bend and grow such that  
The fox and nymph keep finding  
Each other  
And the woods sigh  
When the footsteps of the two  
Are together
