Damn the old
And blame the new
Just let fly the fury flew
What you pitched was nothing new
And what I caught was only you
Falling as you usually do

To sleep on the top of angry dreams
You can't release with angry screams

You're rage is so damn old
And you're soul is so damn cold

I can't figure why I stopped to
	catch you
Falling as you usually do
I supposed that if I hadn't
I'd be falling too
