Laying beneath those roots I heard
The sound of slowly passing planes
Gliding overhead, as a rhythm in the night
A cacophony of combustion 'neath the moon

What a ruinous thing to know now
As I search for my own peace
That no war will grace my plans
As you lie there at my feet

Gracious death, he came too late
Upon his white horse, grayed now with fate
How he scorned me for my smile
And cursed me for my father's desire
For never fighting in your cursed disease

"Go on home now" tot he ghosts I spoke
"You work here is done too many times."
And I searched the stones myself
For some secret scratch that might reveal it

I need to honor you with no gold
I only shed a tear
For how well we could have played
Upon these battlefields here

Did you damn the, so long ago
When one foot they placed into your grave
Did you tell them where to go
While you—sadly—took no shame to carry

Muddied and proud I see you now
A hero you've become
And how I love that flag in which
You're wrapped
Just not the bastards that fly it
While you lie six feet down

Wait a while still for me
I"ll see you soon I fear
Old Death, on time, will come again
And we'll play a while then

Casting off our ravenous histories
Laying down our arms in a lasting defeat
To the stupidity of the fight
Taking off to wild dreams again
A peace, I'm sure, the next time we meet.
