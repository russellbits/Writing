Honey

Drifting on my own in
my old haunt on Canal
old then, new now while
my baby's eyes were now near
(Didn't used to be)
following like the moon
making texts, making papers
all over the ground—
thoughts of her following me.

I had nothing in my head;
nothing in my pockets.
What this place used to be,
this parade on no day going by
with no wave from the
Queen of my parade—
it's odd and all I want
is to see whatever she sees.

Like maybe I'm not looking
really, and my baby's eyes
are like the moon just
a place I'd rather be.
And the trip, the trip?
It takes 100% of me.
It's worth it,
Every orbit.

I'll get back to
those blue moons of mine
Kidnap her to get her
where she wants to be
Give up what no longer
matters to me &
get out of my own way

She will take a bit of time,
Like honey poured from a jar
Slow, requires patience,
Then when it pours,
It covers.
