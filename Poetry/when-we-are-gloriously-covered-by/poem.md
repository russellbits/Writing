It's very nice that you love me
But I'm falling apart as you watch,
Falling off a platform known to me
And throwing detritus overboard
To get to the new place, the new Shore
A long time I’ve sailed; compromised by
Sending smaller pieces, to the ocean below
They call it, removing ballast.

And You might try
Catching pieces of me that are changing, thrown
Even as you change the intentions behind pieces
The detritus remains, hopelessly,
Which what requires love.
Catching some of those falling parts is worthwhile.
Others, I'll happily leave behind for you.
Do with those parts of me what you will.
Museums and ocean bottoms are their resting place.

Your discretion regarding saving any
Pieces of me, is not what you think.
It is a nice hallmark, but
I leave parts behind all the time.
I abandon when inspired
Even parts of myself.
And though I love you,
I know I want the vault of me to keep

I would be a solipsistic fool to think
That you didn’t abandon some
Of the ship of you, arrived joyfully
on the coast of Us.
We showed up
Some accident of the Universe
I curated my equipment
Then threw it overboard because,
Love, in your face,
Seems to demand change
paradoxically.

Which can’t be helped
Hold two people together and they’re
minds align. The self is always
less than any of us
And what we need: admission
Acceptance got me you
Me, plus all my incoherent pieces,
Even elements I would gladly throw overboard
Just for you.

The parts you catch are not
All good or bad
Some failing parts leave me, if only
In your light.
Secret things are also
Afoot to make you happy.
Secrets are not bad; their intent is everything

It’s as if secrets, beyond boundaries
of love and consciousness, are a technology,
The first technology: that of knowledge, beyond Love
That kept us from knowing Love
Always class and money and family has
Fought Love. Wherefore?

When there are no houses,
When their are no politics,
When there is no intervention vis-a-vis Love
We will thrive. All of us.

You and I, that is different.
If the whole world is failing, and falling apart
We have a secret garden.
It is the garden of your mind and my mind—
The garden of our love.
And our secret conversation.
What happens in the bed.
When we are gloriously covered in the weather
In the moments we utter, "I love you."
That makes the new day ahead of Us.
Together.
