# Free at the Top in the Cold

I will tell you thus about myself:
I have a good sense of how to arrive—
bombastically and with good humor.
—wind behind me and the door might slam—
that stops the ice. Arrival
Cute wind
Lovely Snow
I, mostly just am,
in the cold.
Let my lengthier regions go numb—
They were arthritic anyway.
Of no use, they say.

This cold: incorporates several lessons:
Preparation—carry only what you need.
(Consumerism will kill you)
Boldness—know ahead of time who you will meet;
	only then is the confidence yours.
Frustration: let the obstacles be obstacles.
To commiserate: wonder if you could have done better...
What a waste.
Lose the bitching.
Mountains do not bow.
Rocks don't complain.
Rivers don't wine.
They run.

And we should not ask them to.
What else would be climbed?
To choose the foolishness of walking
into winter worse than you can imagine,
To have your breath frozen in your own throat
There's only one dumb species that does that
(Other than penguins, I guess)
The one that will have its breath freezing...
While all around hides
In hovels; quiet, warm
It is bold, I hope you are prepared
and then I wish you luck
And then you will be free.

That wish is not a grant.
You will be lucky to have it;
You will have to find it.
It will cost you. Freedom.

At the top
At the very top
Of all the stone,
Every pile,
Alone
The wind will speak,
The valleys will sigh,
You will hear the Earth,




And you will be immensely cold
At the top
but it will be worth it
You will be free
We are not given what we deserve
The cold has no friends
What we are given,
What we care most about?
Arrives
Just like the cold,
And it will leave us,
And in Spring
Even if we are lucky
Gone still
Still Bold we are, the cold there
Make it a friend and wander.
I see no waste there
Be free
At the top
In the Cold
