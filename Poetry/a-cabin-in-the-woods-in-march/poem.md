A Cabin in Sky Valley in March:

I gave my heart to you
once the day bright, heart bloody,
Heavy, hanging together,
with staples.

Relieved from the weight
I could float off
And revel in absence of
response to craving.

We

We slept juxtaposed to self and bed,
Passions hot and abstentions annulled 
We fucked, and fucked, and fucked, and fucked.

Oh, what a time to be had in Sky Valley!

Then, the airport.
