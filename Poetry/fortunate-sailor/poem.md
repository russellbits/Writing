I sat a while in twilight
Staring into fire
Wrestling with my failures
Attempting to exorcise the demons

Reeling in what could not be done
I felt I began to spin
Spin slowly in a whirlpool
That sucked me quickly down

Then drowning I found more fire
That burned me still in water
For its fuel was so potent
And growing every more so

Be done! I cried
And closed my weary eyes
Forgiving all I could of it
Releasing my weakening grip

I found myself on the top right then
A pleasant green before me
Things behind became flotsam
And I smiled at the journey ahead.
