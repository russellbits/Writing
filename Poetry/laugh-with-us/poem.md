You know we kid ourselves about GRACE
a joke with our sticky finger style of silliness MAKE
faces with our eyes only to pluck them out to juggle and ride unicycles THINGS
fly by and we both wave with a big smile that's like the sky over CIRCUSES
we go to see the clowns and the clowns laugh at us WE
never read the books about secret places SPECIAL
Places  when  We've got a good laugh for refugeâ€”
a place in our heads that STICKS AND SPINS
like an old record of beans and cornbread
so why bother
making sense when sense makes so little?
In a world where you're a SMILE
you chuckle at the theory or principle
pants all pulled way up LAUGH
at rockets leaving the sky

You and I,
We laugh

Pin pricks of roses and melancholy sunsets
are sweet moments that lose their scent and can't
keep up with a good belly laugh and roll in the grass
of Spring, our guts wrenching until it hurts.
