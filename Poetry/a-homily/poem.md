A Homily
I remember being in Highlands, North Carolina, in a Catholic Church where a priest declared that Jesus had not made a miracle, but created one from the goodness of people. I do not know the Gospel, but I know there is a story in which Jesus is speaking and the crowd around him, like an ancient Lalapalooza, is made up with people who came with what they had and those who came with nothing but faith.

Jesus didn't make food, he told people to pass around baskets. In the crowd, there were those who had enough. Those people took what they needed and shared the rest. By the time the baskets came back to Jesus, they were full with gifts! Many people donated to the cause. That is the miracle! We, as a species, a predator with weapons, top-of-the-food-chain threat, can be so kind.

What a foil we have in us.

We are kind and cruel, and it is up to each of us to understand our particular kindness and our particular cruelness. The universe forces choices on us and we make those choices. We make our choices and none of us should judge the other for the choices made because the Universe has treated us differently.

"It's hard to dance with a devil on your back" —Florence and the Machine

The devil on your back—you KNOW what it is. It is something in between your mind and others' minds. It has to do with judgement from others about your kindness or cruelness. You're always dragging your reputation around. Let it go.

Know that the universe is giving you challenges, and that you are on your own path. It is utterly unique. On a giant globe flying around a star, in a solar system spinning around a galaxy, it is guaranteed that your path is unique.

No one can judge you. You are free from that.

The miracle was each one of our kindnesses. The doctors and nurses are not there for us by some miracle. They are our brothers and sisters and they are there because they studied and sought their kindness. Their goodness. Do not thank god for medicine. Thank Goodness. And Kindness.

We are so capable, as a species, to be kind. But power is large and kindness can seem small. I’m pretty sure that Jesus said something like “Let Caesar do his thing, let’s take care of each other.” Again, I think I’ve read the Gospel maybe once... but I feel like I got the point.

Forget Caesar! Be kind to one another. Give of what you have. We’re all in this together. Ubuntu!
