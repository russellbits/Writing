# Little Moon Following

you are all grown up now.

you are all grown up now    but
growing still and will you still be 'round and make it to
the last orbit of the world's daughter
moon?

moon
    is falling while kindly gracious
    in curtsy circle bows
diving
    years carefree in silent space
    past seas she's split and sailed
falling
    faster, faster in her roundandround
    curving the lip edge of the spiral
following
    you, her friend

Don't abandon your childhood pet,
for she always followed you,
before you knew
    who you were
    and that she was just a rock.
You've grown, yes...    and grown up
    but still...

smile.  little moon is following you.
