Of all the glasses I have
far and wide, lenses thorough
through the light given, that have discovered,
Something else

With the far-off stare of Love,
the far-off lands I’ve not yet mapped
a watchman in a crow's nest
swept over the bow a hundred yards for every
wave a  hundred yards high

yelling, hollering, calling impossible signs
Near the edge of what you know
about what ghost ship comes
or nothing at all

You will see shapes in the
collusion of the ocean and the night
Iterant waves, white, gone on a crash
I know you will see them too

It is the beacon of our love
High atop a cape
Beaming one single signal message
“Come back to me.”

How could you see then?

Able to seeing none of it,
other than the possibility, the Future
unaware, steward and statue
-esque. Staring hard, and straining
against an oncoming storm.
Up In the crow's nest,
Smiling in rain,
hard, hurting pains of looking
forward for little to no pay
rain on our eyeballs
Just as the wind begins to howl

I dug, I shoveled, I
My favorite smile, teeth
smashing into rain
And through all this
We felt safe?

Teeth on the roof
There, in the crow's nest...
the horizon holds nothing,
the storm is wildly growing
the forest path leads nowhere
the ocean is infinite,
the hull is empty
The Earth itself is
only
"Everything you cannot imagine:
And an emptying hull, too
Everything that frightens you:

HORRORS
STRANGE HOLES
UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA
FAILURES IN KNOWLEDGE
VIRUSES!!!

Just today:
New York Times headline!
Washington Post headline!
Fox news headline!
Daily Show headline!
Late night headline!"

OK. A Okay.

Come with me.
hundreds of hundreds    of chemicals
dumped in our garden?


I've googled it.
Great creations
Fantastic cities
build three times on top of
themselves.
I can't find evidence of our love.
I don't mind. I love you.
What planet am I on?
I love you.
Planets and orbits are damnned

Worlds... whole worlds.... around us are torn apart
I can't imagine a better
friend, lover, compatriot
for the end of the world.

Sweetness, they've been talking about
the end of the world for as long as there
have been those of us to do the talking.

if you should just stop staring
and staring at the horizon?
Where the darkness of the ocean
and the night are trades in blue
Where will you stare?

When everything was stolen from me
The first feeling was that I would never
get it back again:
heart, money, stuff and roof

Time only taught me that getting back
money, stuff and roof was stupid
when seen next to
heart

With the far-off stare of
a watchman in a crow's nest
searching between everything you can see
and nothing at all
Still you will see shapes in the
colusion of the ocean and the night
I know you will see them
I watch you watch

My mind sometimes goes off to a little
death
