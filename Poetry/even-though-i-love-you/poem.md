You are not the sand
Nor are you the sea
But something serpentine
		Lying there between
		
You are not the stars
Nor could you be the moon
Though all my night's heavens
		you do consume
		
You are time and space
And other abstract things
Ethereal, bizarre
Like flight without wings

So may you fly away
Beyond my grasp
Lest I should stay
though my soul collapse
