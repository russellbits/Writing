You said what you said
Only so you could say it
No impressions you made
Blatant statement's all you said

Talk to me
Talk to God
Try to wake the dead
Your statement passed
Through cold lips
Past unwinding ears
And floated out
Into empty space
Never made a dent
Or changed a mind
Just filled the empty space
