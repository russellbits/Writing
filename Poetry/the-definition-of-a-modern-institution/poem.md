They had the decency to tell the truth
to my face and even pat me on the knee,
and it sank in slow, the information.
Days of playing games about the future

followed until I just wanted to punch a train.
Not being an Atlas, I can't punch the world, and
can't let Lady Karma know I think she sucked it.
What she had in store was stowed in
some storm cellar and she hid it from me,
down in the DNA.

It takes a big deep breath
It takes a silent moment
It takes being alone
And then,

Bring on that train. I'm gonna punch it.
Flatten me it might,
but ocean waves and avalanches...
You can cower or grit your teeth.

Those are the only choices.
If Lady Karma gives any choices at all.
