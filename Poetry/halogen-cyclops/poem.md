My buddhist engine kitten purs
down a long drawn gruesome road
black like snakes that slither for me
there beneath a big screen sky
faster, faster speed ahead I
Two and twenty cigarettes left behind
The land, my rind
my weary christian soldier
command the lines I
Bend with will, speed with might
and race and spin and call the night
My own sweet lover's tongue

My buddhist engine kitten purrs
down a long drawn gruesome scar
black like a skinned stretched snake
there beneath a big screen sky
faster, faster speed ahead I
Two and twenty cigarettes left behind
The land, my rind
my weary christian runover soldier
command the lines, bend with will,
pull the acceleration, kick the gear
race and spin, grind and grrrr
making the purple distance
my sweet lover's tongue
