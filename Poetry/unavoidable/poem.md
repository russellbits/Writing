(Setup)
Moving with a powerful thrust
(Physics) tells us to be [care][ful]
Next to the thrill of the
		carousel motions's gravity
Circles of inner orbits
Protrude into what should be
		= your fate
(i) five years old -> look before you cross
(ii) twenty years old -> look before you leap
Into
		=(y)our fate
CRASH
"... I really didn't think..." (Know)
("I am not omniscient.")

(Evaluation)
Comets, planets, uncaring globes
Such simple chemistry
When compared to the single
Symmetry
The human mind
Is of universal depth so
Such abstraction is legitimate

You were unavoidable
And apologies make for
A good canvas
