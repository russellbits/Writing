If I composed a Friday and
thought that the next thing
that could happen would be
running into Amanda

I might put masking tape
across my eyes my eyebrows
just to look like Frida Kahlo
and then go look at the ocean.

I might cut ping pong balls in half
Maybe glue them to some
statue I couldn't care about
Whatever, civil war jerks.

And I might play some melancholy album
On and on on a hot afternoon
Not move from the floor
Stare at the ceiling fan

If I breezed by some stupid
and weird mall called "The Place"
we could look in and see
How weird was it?

There might be a detective
agency and I would love to
know what the case was
when my niece was days away.

If I thought my sister could change
the weather, I wonder
Which way
Amanda When
Cold, wind, hot, pouring
I've no idea.

But she can change the weather.
