# In Between Dreamy Guesses

perhaps you’re washing a dish when
a bird out the window catches your attention or

you’re filling out that frustrating online form
when the dog does something stupid or

the log on the fire falls the wrong way,
so you need to push it with something...

you look for the implement... but which one?
Your mind goes from tool to that time that... that...
but history is gone as soon as it dawns in your mind
So you shake your head,
wonder if you're cracking up
the moment you seek... or forget.
What were you looking for?

this quiet we’ve come to suspect
That barely known of what
you can remember... or forget?
Even you can't precisely find
what you've hid.

You’ll hear it calling...
The return from that drift away

The tide when
a present arrives, or it takes one
turn from the goal of whatever
implement that wasn't the memory

Now when you find it again,
everything you reached for,
Now joy has come your way!
And it feels like providence.

Still you look up
to find an odd red star with light
that is 37 billion years old
but you think it’s Mars... ol' Mars... not a star
In the cold and dark (it's Sirius)
you're accidentally disoriented
from the entire Universe.

Don't orient. Breathe deep.
    You don't know where you are most of the time.
So red stars look like Mars.
Where are you supposed to go?

This Universe won't save you
seems not to help much at all
as far away as it all is
where are you supposed to go!?

To get away from the awfulness of
The gravity of EV-ery single  single instance
of argument or regret or just not BEING THERE
of losing yourself in the tumult and not the sky.

Come back again,
from the dark new moon's reverie,
where the moment has nowhere to go
when the distance of the stars dawn
on you,

the fall will seem infinite
or just where you've been
and know that
while looking for a handhold
the leap will not be safe.
It's a cliff.
