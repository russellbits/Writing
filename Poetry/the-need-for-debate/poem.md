What I believe is not:
What I suspect is not:
What I cannot prove is not:
What We might know.

My sentence comes first;
Perhaps an arrogant hypothesis.
But no sentence from me to you
is going to change youâ€”
any utterance of mine barely compares
to the majesty that's happened to
You

This space and flying rock
On which You occurred and moved through the Universe
Is likely not duplicated.

Talking
and Hawking
and jokes of persuasion
and Yelling
Insults
Rhymes of derision
Nothing of this
is going to change You
Any utterance barely compares
to the majesty that's happened to
You
As you have been moved through

This space and flying rock
On which You occurred and moved through the Universe
Is likely not duplicated.

We do change, now and again,
From discussion
We exchange
And change
In conversation.

The architecture of conversation
which is easy:
Do you know what I know?
Have you seen what I've seen?
What do you think about that?

And the architecture of conversation
which is difficult:
Can you know what I know?
Why haven't you seen what I've seen?
What do you think about that?

Now,
We can speak.
Spinning together on the same rock
We might be halfway there
As this first conversation requires simpler questions:
"What is your name?"
"How are you?"
"Are you doing well?"

Beliefs
finish these questions took
To test the water
And after the water flows,
The peace can be a spell,
Cast by ourselves.

If you          listen
We know one thing:
Death is imminent.

Let us converse together.
Before Death.
Let us converse
Before the end.

This space and flying rock
On which You occurred and moved through the Universe
Is spinning through space at an incredible rate
No direction
We are Ubuntu
Together, here.
