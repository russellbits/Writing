I know a bird:
Of beautiful plumage,
A crown of gold,
the song of a mother,
the kindness of a soul
healed after wounds

Her feathers bend bright
against a smoky, noisy sky.
Sometimes she even
bends a dark night
To her strike

Her songs can be 
Taken in and drowned by
noise, corruption, chaos,
too near her nest.
For that

Her songs can be 
Taken in and drowned by
noise, corruption, chaos,
too near her nest.

She is a very ancient nymph
Preaches: Hope is always upside down
