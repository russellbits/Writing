Mangled, dangled, dashed and trashed
The electricity flows through you
My electric eye with a laser scans
The fax that spews a bloody hand
Trapped within the monitors
Glass spheres, fools and dreams
How immortality gleams

Mortaged your should to me
Me and my electricity
Which will rush you, crush you
		touch you
From a million miles away
Spewing from the comlines
Oozing from ezines
Frankly I don't care for spam
I'd rather juice a flame
Steal email, ftp a file
And jam your transmission
With a disease of 1's and 0's
