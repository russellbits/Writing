# Beanth the Manhattan Bridge at Night in Autumn
They were little hopes and confidences
gold lit secrets hidden 'neath bridges under bridges
where she came to himâ€”already two months gone
to see how he was getting on
just to see where she used to sit
in the shadow of the bottom corner of his lip

His brown eyes stray from shoe to shoe
Himself hidden in his pockets, he keeps from view
of the bridge's rumbling as a trains clack by
drowning out the Autumn in his sigh
the air so cool and crisp keeps
the dearest words in silence

like the little hopes and confidences
love in nooks so tucked in their heart
where he's a passage now and leaving
she is twenty minutes away from home
though present, he's done, already gone
she still wonders what he'll do alone

just before she steps and lightly falls a bit
into his arms from beyond the rift
she quiet slips around his middle
softly enwrapped, he misses her a little
embraced they are like bridges beneath bridges
between the walls and alleys where they're hid
