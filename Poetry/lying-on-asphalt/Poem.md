The rain comes tapping
Wetted secrets splatter
Across my brow, my boots
As I stand and watch the sky explode
Standing grey [sic] inherent
To lay that single rose
Among the death of rumors

Misery she runs to run
Cackled laughter cries out
While I classify some part
Of my simple sorrow
File it away

Bungled in the mind we are
Horrified by black and white
But not the elegance of wings
Elegance all gone away now

Dust from the sun it fired
And confronted us so solemn
When a piece of paper
Your harsh look
Was what I became
