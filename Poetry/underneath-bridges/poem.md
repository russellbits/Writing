# Underneath Bridges

They were little hopes and confidences
golden lit secrets hidden beneath bridges under bridges
where she came to him, already two months gone
just to see how he was getting on
to see where she used to sit
in the shadow of the bottom corner of his lip

His brown eyes stray from shoe to shoe
hidden in his pockets, he keeps from view
of the bridge's eyes, as a trains clack by
drowning out the Autumn in his sigh
the air so cool and bitter crisp
keeps the dearest words silenced

like the little hopes and confidences
love in nooks so hidden in their heart
where he's a passage now and leaving
she is twenty minutes away from home
though present, he's done, already gone
she still wonders what he'll do alone

just before she steps and lightly falls a bit
into his arms from beyond the rift
she quiet slips around his middle
soft enwrapped he misses her a little
they embrace like bridges beneath bridges
and between the walls and alleys where they're hid
