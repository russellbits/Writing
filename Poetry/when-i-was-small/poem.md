When I was small I crawled between
The couch and the wall
And though I not fit
I pressed

My mother would say to stop

When I was small I wanted my way
I help my breath until
I passed out

My mother would say to stop

When I was small my mother said
Pick up your toys when you're done with them
I don't believe I did
And neither does she

Today I am not small
And the toys lay around the house
The house is old; the closets are full
She cannot press; she cannot say stop

She will stop
I will not
I will miss her saying stop.
