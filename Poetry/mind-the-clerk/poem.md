And I remember that I have a priestess
AND a religion, you godless fools!
MY GOD is real. But I've 11,000 ideas of what SheHeit is
I've spent so much time thinking about
God or No God, I missed the middle way
All God, All the time!

Who gives a shit of what SheHeit is; when SheHeit wants to speak to you

You'll know.
In the meantime, mind the clerk.

â€”I write like it matters; whether it's worth money is above my pay grade.
