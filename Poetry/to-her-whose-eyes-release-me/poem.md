Accosted by shadows of fear
In a darkened park one eve
I ran to a nearby light
The yellowish glow of a street lamp
Enshroud by the fog

There stood a lone figure
The essence of grace
It was as though angels flew
To shift her appendages
A gesture of a hand
Upon her own cheek
Seemed only similar
To a gust of wind
On a warm Spring day

The cold fog had dampened us both
But the cold depth of
Her stare
Chilled me far more
My fear of the shadows
Seemed to flee
Front he greater anticipation
That seemed to radiate
From this fallen angel

What had I done to gain this
Idol of fearsome beauty?

A trophy to win she was not for
She stood on no pedestals
Instead she seemed to float
Just above the ground
Still within my grasp
But never would she
Have to stand
On the same cursed ground as me

Forever
Dodging and glancing
With swift fury
She could evade all my plans
My aspirations

Like the clouds

She drifted above me
So near to the torch
But just beyond
My straining grasp

She releases me
And now
now I can fly
With the other
Softly crying gulls
That I have so often sought to be among.
