The blessing of this modernity is lost on me.
In awe, I look out on massive buildings, engines, experiments
seeing Life now occurring in sections, parts and lanes
all souring, all gripped and ripped and pulled apart
until we make it new again,
all the while, running out of new somehow.

I see particulates coalesce into the scent for a new kind of Death,
enshrouded in improbability, black flared nostrils searching,
for the Ignored, the Unknown.
The methods of its reaching hands are now a rotting from within,
if only because the fragile nature of our ideas extend forever
formed into the thousand things we've made, and make over and over and over...
Our artifacts will never rot as
quick as our bones and our bones
will never rot as quick as our wills.
This New Death knows how to take us.

Old Death finds it hard to kill importance
And our embodiment in Signals is now
All that we privileged industrial electric apes desire.
Though with this evolution an end more insidious
arrives for us, for it's a present hell.
The apprentice of Death wears an impossibly bright cloak these days.
10,000 suns fuel the informational dismemberment of Truth.
Where once a black cowled skull came to take us,
now we are taken every day by the face of a thousand adoring eyes
a collective succubus of consciousness.
A more loving stare could never be so horrible
but for this new broadcast century of ours.
This new apprentice does not bother me, though, for I see water go over rocks into a fall
and I do not know the name of the place.
I do not name the water.
We try. We name our possession of it—the places we tread
 And this is all the better to freeze it. To keep it,
in us—where we find our favored delusion of permanence.

We will name the nanometer of the wavelength of light
The red, green, the blue, yellow and ignore, discard
poor photons that come to us from two hundred million light years away.
Shy particles, fantastic diplomats from distant galaxies and times, do not interrupt our
pictures-of-me-in-front-of-building-X... or the news reports of crashes and bombs.

Do we truly seek a vaccine for invisibility?
Must the outlier be murdered in the name of the trend?
The measure of every of human talent
in all their prettiness of persuasions, or pretentiousness
in all their lies, fruitless efforts, delusional permanence,
we do forge a promise.
We are makers.
We are the enemies of Death in all its forms.

I wonder why we have forged this alliance with New Death.
Why we secretly acknowledge that we must sacrifice our children
in order to be seen?
So much of what we've done was surely never intended by the heavens! The luck of our constructions is amazing—
eddies, currents, deltas of augmented reality,
an arrogance arising from a reshaping and
an invention—a million new universes to come.

Old Death's apprentice will catch up with us.
for all our electronic discoveries and revenges,
all are filed under the heading: Life.
The one rule that governs both, is
a rule that New and Old Deaths know well:
the Measure. All effort will result in cruel
units,
for Measurement is God.

Life is a fall and not a place...
...a dynamic and not a status...
a passing and not remembrance.
This New Death knows.
Fear not the cloak of his obscurity,
your creation is light.
