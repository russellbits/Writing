Era, era
moon
naughty cousin of mine
planes that glide...
over cleavage work
never play
sings the reverb
guitar scream in night
beneath
moon
to come again
long carrying it home
sing guitar--screan in night
of cat's native sand
they sing,
"Era, era moon!"
in the suburb
see the chorus symmetry
sameness
modified
"That's it!"
Seen it, *been* it
sometime
era, era moon,
baby
