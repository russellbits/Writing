# I Never Thought of You

I never thought of you  
for the many, many years  
you were away from me.  
In the way that for  
many, many years  
I never even thought of myself.  
There was a darkness  
And then there was a light.  

One day, I was  
It was fuzzy at best  
And that was not my birth  
Just age, just coming on line  
I got older by months  
The world turned, 
the solar system spun—
flew through the Milky Way

And I never thought of you.
I never dreamed of your eyes
I never imagined your laugh
I would have, if I could have
You were not impossible,
just far beyond my ken, my grasp
You were not yet a racing of my heart
You were not yet a tingling on my skin
You were not yet an obsession in my mind

You were brilliant,
I know now
and hidden away from me.
Until any night, for any reason
You said something close to me;
handed me a diamond—
A memory, A gem.

I cannot place it now
I did not think of you and then
The moment flashed by
And love like a tide
Washed over me from nowhere

The world still turns,
the solar system still spins—
We still fly through the Milky Way

But now the spark of your eyes,
the joy of your laugh,
That diamond, that gem
that I cannot place
I know that it is the heart that beats near our meeting.

I never thought of you
And now I wonder, late at night
Lying awake
Do we come from the same stars?
Will that moment that I saw you—
the possibility of you—
the colors, the music, the warmth—
Will it be preserved by the Universe?
By the photons of our smiles?
Traveling light years away from us,
Spinning in the dark?

No loner that same darkness,
that was where I could not think of you.
Where I did not know you.

I never thought of you.
I do now.
Constantly.
