Meiosis saved his soul from hell
As soldiers finished dying still
Glad to see the sky was crying
As fall came on, dreary trotting
For it rained a lot, I understand
When he reigned, lying

He looked ahead as planets spun
Fueled in heat by languid gin
A priest upon a motorbike
The dust of sins he meant to smite
Just being the fuel he needed
Since God could never help him any

But that was din, and this is how
The sweat will breed upon his brow
Since he's never scorched a wedding dress
Though I believe he's tried a bit
Pretty sure he never will
And his perfume's prettier

Watch for him, for he watches you
In the televisions everywhere
Raping skies of their heathen blue
Bastions of the demons follow him
Carving out his so-loud hollow
But I bet he'll fall again.

He loves the fall.
