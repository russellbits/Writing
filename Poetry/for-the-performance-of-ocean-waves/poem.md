Those souls you encroach and invite in
vampires of your integrity
on the TV and radio
touch you not
that fame for fame
is the worse for knowing where you stand
just near
that hill Tabor over there
but ariande grande and donald trumps don’t
And get ready....
Because what is real is insanely mundane guaranteed time and time again because it’s boring or known and what’s the value of the known versus what we’re used to.
And what’s the value in that?
Something distant is more interesting.
Something strange\
Souls unused to that encroach on you, angels of just making you tell the truth
vampires of your integrity
on the TV and radio
That fame can go fuck itself.
Three quarter clouded moon
over ocean’s persistent crystal light
dances the path to walk
alone in any night-time myopia
silence stills the heady
dialogue of bright day
and moon’s wide and fuzzy halo
is a quiet amphitheater
Because what is real is insanely mundane guaranteed time and time again because it’s boring or known and what’s the value of the known versus what we’re used to.
And nobody has to fucking do it!
No one’s still just told me where Tabor is.
for the performance of ocean waves
their dark body, bright foam, an inverted tide
come to take all
your should’ves away.
and lap
deep thunderous.Astoria, sure
But God Damn it, I want to climb a little hill.
Just a little hill, before I go.
I deny worship, anyone good would
just come a little ways up the hill with me.
