I want to ravage you, but  
instead I will kiss every inch &  
spill some sense of me into you.  
The idea of you coming apart  
is only nice if you shout gleeful  
while I do it, my Lavalamp.  

I want to put you into me, but  
instead I will pull at every muscle  
until the stress collapses, and exhausted  
you like dough release and just coo  
without any choice, my Bamboo.  

I want to mash your face, but  
instead I will just get very close  
so your ear can know my breath  
as I whisper silly nothings then  
I can stare into your eyes &  
see into that window of yours , Starshine    

I want to devour you, but  
instead I will lightly nibble  
in every place you think is secret,  
will not rest until every hair stands  
until you close your eyes,  
in total quivering ecstasy, Cuddle Puddle.  

In that ocean of kissing, thrashing  
I only want to drown, like beneath waves  
Of you, with your crushing pressure  
That squeezes my want into combustion
Where only then can you give me air,  
My Fluffy Little Cloud,  
My Dirty Little Koala  
My golden heart  
My Love
