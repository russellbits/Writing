Some time ago  
I wanted to quit this game  
I had a plan  
To put myself in front of a train  
Because I love trains  
So let it end like that.

But there were people who liked me  
And I called them on the phone
I listened  
Let the tethers of friendship consume  
Me  
Let my plan  
Go  

You can always  
Fuck off to Patagonia  
"You don't seem like a man  
Who wants to give up."  
An old friend from a  
long time ago  
said to me.

So, I did.  
(in my mind)
Out into the woods I went  
chopped wood, carried water,
broke it all down.  
& found  
no Purpose,  
no Meaning.

Worked anyway to make Life  
better for that no reason.
Tired keeps you from even a walk
because you can sleep the season
hibernation never
hikes ten miles
with a heavy pack.

It's in you.
The weight helps.
For bridges, for chasms,
For vales, for hollers.
For waterfalls, for secret creeks

I came back
&
Lo and behold,
she showed up.

She says she manifested me and
I believe her.  
It makes no sense.
But then, neither do I.  

In trying to find the meaning  
in crows chasing hawks,
I saw the woods for what they are: 
The Unknown;
My favorite thing  
in this life:  
The question.

She is that.  
Which I can't wait to find out
The question,
Bothering me
What fun is coming to us?
Beautiful Nicolle,  
I love you
I'll make up names  
For you  
Every day
It won't stop!
