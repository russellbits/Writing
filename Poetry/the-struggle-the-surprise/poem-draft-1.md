PART 1
The Struggle

Some time ago,
I wanted to quit this game.
I had a plan to put myself
in front of a train.

I love trains;
let it end like that.

But there were people who liked me
& I called them on the phone & listened  
Let the tethers of friendship consume
Let my plan  
Go.  

You can always  
Fuck off to Patagonia, an old friend from a  
long time ago  said to me.
Dead now. Still, he speaks,
"You don't seem like a man  
Who wants to give up."  
So, I didn't. 
& out into the woods I went  

I chopped wood, I carried waterâ€”
Broke it all down.  
& found  
NO Purpose,  
NO Meaning,
NO Reason
Just woke up. 
Get the water. Cut the wood.
Move.
Hope the nightmares stay with the creek.
Hope the aches will quit by noon.

The woods paint a fractacality
Your eyes cannot measure (try they might)
The news, the Internet, the phone, all silenced
You have to listen to the roots
And your footsteps, right and left
The painting has you in it.

I worked to make Life  
better for that no-reason.
Hibernation, Tired & Sad, keeps you from even a walk
because you can sleep the season;
But I tell you, my weighted ones,
The pain cannot keep up with
the day you hike ten miles
with a heavy pack.

You.
Walking you.
The weight helps.
For bridges, for chasms,
For vales, for hollers.
For waterfalls, for secret creeks.
In every one, you will find wonder.

And the return to the World?
You will; if you pay bills.
But the catastrophe,
It's smoke
Can be wiped clean from your eyes

I came back
&
Lo and behold,
She showed up.



PART 2
The Surprise



She says she manifested me and
I believe her.  
It makes no sense,
but then, neither do I,
Not after being gone.

In trying to find the meaning  
in crows chasing hawks,
I saw the woods for what they are: 
The Unknown.
A Mystery.
My favorite thing : The question.

She is that.  

Which I can't wait to find out
The question bothering me
The question bothering her
A temple of conversation,
just waiting to be built.

This love feels like archaeology
Old and newly discovered.
When I'm with her
The stars make sense
Even though I know they've moved
But deepness gets us nowhere

The mystery is
Her laugh.
Move those stars.
I know she does.
