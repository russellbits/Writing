Slowly spinning buddha fishes near my head
With the great eight arms of Paul cutting them dead
How many times will the iron bell ring
Before the goes are all only over
Like the times that you are
When I fall
How I'd love to burn you

"Francis, dear, I think I'm dying."

bureaucrats in bottles bang on the purple drain
And my birthday acid skin takes away the pain
How many holes does it take to fill my mind
decrepit hairy flies leaving me no rhymes
Gone down for a while
As we fell
How I'd love to take you

"Francis, dear, I think I love you."

i saw the photographs of the shattered wallets
With no money all the while I watched
So I let the house fall in as the armies charged
and i took my lonely mother away
Her looks distilling fears of
fall falling down
I'd love to burn you
