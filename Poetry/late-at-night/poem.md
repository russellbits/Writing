stroll with a blast like brass
of foggy streets that turn real fast
each footstep unbetrayed
and looking down to each alleyway
where mostly darkness lies
the imagination lights
every single glint reflected
in your own white eyes
nothing you saw you think you did
an alley cat or falling trash can lid
as each a life and splitting
between the life of now or then
somehow as you pierce the lens
through all things darkness bends
look down and deep into the form
the walls that lead and corridor
an ephemeral place you go
wavery not quite there in to and fro
by overstep and offstep you seem
to come 'round the same spot
clean and lick the paws
cat your stray and like the rot
the pungent smell of things forgot
you relish in the night dreams
as they fade away
into black
