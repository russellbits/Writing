Ever dance the San Gennaro?
Ever walked Cafe Le Feet on grass?
Ever seen the subway cuddled?
Or a skyline through another's glance?

A birthday back a while I had
Though no one could no my wish
In the recklessness of growing old
And risking time you cannot own

In she came and for no reason
She came in like the seasons
And came to find the night with me
So while the night was young...

We danced the San Gennero
Walked cafe le fem in grass
Cuddled dear and tight the subway
Saw the skyline through each others' glance

A birthday back a while I had
As I grow older and still wonder
Over all I have yet to do
And who to do it with...

I wish she comes and for no reason
Delights in us just like the seasons
For I felt that autumn watched with care
As we danced the San Gennaro's air
