# A Quintet of Love Poems
## *In the key of Kate*

### 1.
#### How Many Stars?

From Dark. Nothing. No Space. Then,
<br>
Fire—of the Prometheus kind!
As one law of physics de-generates
into four, maybe
quantoelectromagnagravitation
(Whatever they call it these days)
<br>	
A shredding of the what was [if it was maybe ever at all]
now space, is also some
collection of the opposite of
swirling
You know, SOME thing
The vast collection of SOMEthing appears in the darkness
made the first Galaxies...
networks of them...
pulling light in tight
to keep out the ever-accelerating
foreverness

Even in that desert of darkness
A billion trillion lights start to burn in the night
Stars burn bright in the trillions
Stars burst apart in the billions
Stars collapsing make Nitrogen, Calcium, Iron!

***

You and I are Nitrogen, Calcium, Iron, and much more
manufactured for us by the Stars

In common conversation it would be ridiculous to say
that we're not from the same planet.

Is it ridiculous to ask if are we from the same stars?
How many stars did it take to make this place?
For us to meet?

How many stars made us?—put us together?

### 2.
#### I Never Thought of You.

I never thought of you.
For many, many years you
were away from me.
And for many, many years,
I never even thought of myself.
Then, one day, I was. Or were.
It was fuzzy, at best.
And that was not even my birth
Rather, my age
<br>
I got older by months
The world turned, the solar system spun
The system flew through the Milky Way
Turned and turned
<br>
I never thought of you.
You were not something to think about.
You were not impossible, but
far beyond my ken
<br>
Long before I thought
Love was complete
Long before I knew love of your kind
I had no idea of it.
<br>
Is knowing yourself
and then knowing others
and then feeling a panic
before you find love
a way through?
Or maybe love should be like the tide
<br>
I never thought of you.
You were not something to think about
You were brilliant, I know now, and studied away
You were thinking about other things
<br>
When we met, I thought nothing of you.
We had a conversation—
just like anyone could.
Any night, any reason.
You said something close to me;
handed me a diamond.
<br>
The spark in your eye, that night
The joy of your laugh
That diamond, that night
I cannot place it
And I wish I could, the
memory, the gem...
<br>
I know that it is the heart
that beats near our meeting.
I never thought of you
I do now.
Constantly.

#### Wolf

Are you there are you there
Here I come
Are you okay be okay!
Well, that's okay I'll nuzzle you
<br>
Are you my pack? are you with me
I don't think you smell like my pack
I don't like you a lot
How do I know you're in my pack?
<br>
Well that smells all right
Where's my bestest buddy? He
smells good all right bestest smell!
He's all right; where is he?--
<br>
HI! You're cute. Can I follow you
around—ouch!—okay
I wonder if rabbits around
I smell... I smell.. huuuuh
Hi! You're cute. Can I follow you
around—ouch!
<br>
But wait, I do smell blood
And also... my pack
I smell my bestest
There's a howl and they are gathering
What friends I have!
<br>
They let me gnaw at the bowels
I get some good thigh meat too
The blood tastes sweet to me
The iron taste I lap up with my tongue
<br>
Are you there are you there
Here I come
Are you okay be okay!
Well, that's okay I'll nuzzle you

#### And If the Stars Get Boring
Having held you, I know
You’ve freed me.
with built-in software that keeps copying us over and over an dover andveroen and ovvver
SHAP SERP
PERHAPS the power in that gathering herd
Is the ability to breathe and flex
And in doing so change slightly the Universe
<br>
in which we are utterly trapped             ratpped...?
<br>
SPERHAP
<br>
Like the heart muscle			in everyone, ever
Each heart comes and goes
like fruit on a biological vine
buds, grows, is consumed, buried, or rots
All of them
All of Us
<br>
Every heart ever
<br>
PERHAPS we could negotiate a way to share the world
Hearts on a wall, each one executed
We can't be such terrible copiesWe can't be such terrible copies
We can't terriblebe such  copies
can'tcopiWe terriblebe such  es!
such  epiWe terribs!can'tcopiWe terrib
<br>
But like a heart muscle
Perhaps
We pulse and our inflections
Change everythingChange everythingCha
ChanChange everything

Change everythingthing
<br>

Or know
The stars made just you from nothing
<br>
I like you, Starstuff. Please carry on.

#### The Photons of Our Smiles

Traveling at the speed of light
that bounced off of what I hadn't even seen yet
in that who knows light speed place
Your glance
Lit the space around us.     And
Was the center of the party!
<br>
When we first met, our eyes locked
and there was light between
you and I
That shocked me
You were something else
<br>
There is us somewhere out
in the Universe—light running
The colors, the music, the warmth
When I first saw you...
<br>
I am sure the moment is preserved by the Universe
by photons of our smiles
Still traveling light years away from
Us, I hope, smiling at one another again
Out there in the stars; forever.
