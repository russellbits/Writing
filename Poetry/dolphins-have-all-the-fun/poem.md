I’ve got pretty barbed wire near my door
I’ve got asphalt for the ground
I’ve got chicken wire taller than me
And I’m six foot!

Nobody comes around here
Without unlocking a couple of locks
Nobody has business here unless
I say so.

I have a screen in my cage
That shows me dolphins
They play and learn each other’s names
They come up with pod names

What we would call gangs
That I keep out, with my fence
And don’t want around or ward off
With electric lights.

But what do dolphins do in the dark?
