The candles blue their sparkle
amidst a crowd of silhouettes
with voices that sparkle sound
each a fingerprint upon your ear
as though to see would be
to touch just the same
and so sight is blinding
where we are blurred by music
and a dance of tongues
a babel you cannot follow

just like in the dusk falling
the birds are invisible calling
the leaves, a dome, you hear
but look up how often?
look and what would you see
the passing, and look straight to time
not tap a foot
