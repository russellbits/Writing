Introductions are generally random
when placed alongsside other life-affirming
occurrences—seeing a sunrise—
made of misplaced motivations
by friends of good-intentioned friends.
They waltz away as to say, "Be careful,
I've only set the fuse!"

This hello, this hey, this so, this oh no you go first
start the ambiguity of conversation
that has nowhere to go
where stares do not equal years
but the eye contact, precise milliseconds
feels like windows to eons.

Each stare, so persuaded,
down at the table, the bar, the wall...
avoiding that first impression we
are always told so much to invigorate
cruelly left behind at the first sign
of nervous I don't want to be here,
and that small shadow of who you really are.
Maybe call them passing words in hallways,
or shoved down stairs; one never knows...
Sorry your name was... ?
Did I see you at... ?

I couldn't call you anything
In those early seconds
I recall nothing from
those early seconds
And now
I can never forget your face
