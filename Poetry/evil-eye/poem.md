Single melted globular ball
Sticking, looking through the glass
Kissing Saints and Demons
But only through the glass

Fancy can't change the clasp
And unlock your pity
Retribution makes a bolt
Of simple lonely misery

A spark, the wire churns
Your blue eye turns
Forced by magnetism's evil claw
God can't help you now

What a new and lovely creature
Your eyeball flies away
Leaves you lying on the ground
Better now without your vision
