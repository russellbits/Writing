If I caution you from the seed you want and need,
Bluebird,
I will sit a little ways away
and I won't bother you none.

If I could be invisible to your watch,
Bluebird,
I would do such just to let you
feed and be at peace.

If I could be a secret unknown to you,
Bluebird,
A secret untold I would be, and I
would smile
in the sunlight, still and unseen.

And, If my contentment could be fed
with living just like you do,
Bluebird
Then I would wish to do just that,
And I not bother you none, Bluebird
