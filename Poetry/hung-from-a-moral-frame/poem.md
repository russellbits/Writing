Holy, holy philosophy
Cartesian martyr hung
From lofty goals, churches strong
cathedrals high and made of stone
excellent manufacturing hands that smooth
and necks so long and burned
ideas that float away in sync with prayers
and lighter than air
more golden than sun
comes logic tromping and push away the stone before the cave
free those heroic thoguhts
from lines that were caught
auspiciously
wherefore thee primordial being
if all this may not be?
