Rain like sleepy locusts
Befell the window pane
Slapping near a sleeping cat
And night is just a bigger blanket
As the storm makes us close
A quiet dance in. Darkness
With sudden illumination
Stillness comes to keep the sleep
And we wake to a softer dawn
Wet with no worries
Just the comforting warmth of two
And a pattering on the glass
