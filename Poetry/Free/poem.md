I will tell you thus about myself:
I have a good sense of how to arrive—
Bombastically and with good humor.
Still though, it is no humor that stops the ice.
And it does not mean I will be on time—
Cute wind
Lovely Snow
I mostly just am, in the cold:
This incorporates several lessons:
Preparation—carry only what you need.       (Consumerism will kill you)
Boldness—know ahead of time who you will meet;
	only then is the confidence yours.
Frustration: let the obstacles be obstacles.
To commiserate, wonder if you could have done better...
What a waste.
Mountains do not bow.
And we should not ask them to.
What else would be climbed?
To choose the foolishness of walking
Into winter worse than you can imagine,
The one that will freeze your breathing...
It is bold, I hope you are prepared and then I wish you luck.

Still,
We are not given what we deserve.
The cold has no friends.
What we are given,
What we care most about
Like the cold,
Will leave us,
Even if we are lucky.

Still Bold we are, the cold there.
I say make it a friend.
Just me.
Make it a friend and wander.
I see no waste there.
