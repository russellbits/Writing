I grew up while 
The ever-present threat  
That happened in bureaucratic minds;  
Just robbed the children  
With political panic.  

I talked to acolytes  
Who demanded that I read a book: 
the total catastrophic explanation.  
Not only did I refuse  
I convinced this apparition  
that she was also dreaming  
So, who, then, was the dreamer?  

Still, I day-dreamed about time-traveling  
to a bar to fist fight my Dad. Same age.  
The dream ended  
I awoke defeated.  

I would—I know him. 
He trained HARD, he SWAM in Arizona. 
You swim HARD  
where there is no water. 

~~In one dream of mine, I woke up~~
~~Having survived a nuclear explosion~~
~~Having dreamed of Death~~
~~I awoke elated~~

~~I do not know that;~~ I've not burned


~~A final dream:~~


All my strength lay in persevering.
A stamina reveals no secrets while  
corridors of anxiety in the mind  
Can't beat God and don't want to  
"in God's hands" now  
Remembering the worry is the sin. 

I've gotten hit in the face and just knocked out;
"in God's hands"  
And not forgotten—  
just some stupidity that came  
From nobility, privledge  
—infected in me—
ideas born  
before me
Just a coming.

Big, unnamed, forgotten thugs  
Re-surface at Captain Jack's in Jersey City  
Where in the past I'm dumb enough to stand   
Between a bully and a target 
a "friend", and  
like a sack of potatoes, I go down 

"Wow. I've a glass jaw"   
I've worked so little at fighting.
And it's been a luxury; still   
every other day I think this:  

The difference between the punch   
And getting in the way of it
is like  
A wave from the high tide coming  
Standing with your back to the Pacific Ocean
You will not see it  
Or notice when it knocks you down  

To care counts hard  
hurts,
standing between the tide and a wall  
will be the thing you   
Wail at later, because  
the ocean will never answer you.

Then again, my thoughts. 
don't hold sway over me  
and here I am writing...   
"I've a glass jaw"?  
"I'm a sack of potatoes"?  

I won't go down every time.  
And being not my thoughts,  
Being made of beach and dirt  
I am both mythic champion  
and useless automation  

What is? false about  
A dumb, naïve punishment bag  
that means to  
protect the less  
or give  
In the midst of a  sound thump against the skull  
that resonates in your jaw?  
The intent?  
And in that pain—  
Not much else?

Beaten, stand anyway   
The world owes you one thing—  
One thing only, on the day you are born:  
Death  

I might have been right  
I was probably wrong. 
I was misguided and still. 
I was firm if ill. 
After... embarrassed... no less willing. 
I know   
We still must stand against that ocean
