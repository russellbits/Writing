# Hi, Chimera

Hi, chimera
Flower alone in the garden
Strange you are
Wonderful eyes,
Unknown sight
Lovely in your way
Star to the left
As I navigate
The ones who talk, (ugh)
Let them be normalâ€”what a joke
If that could be defined.
They'll reason it
Chimera remains

Hi, chimera
How are you?
I'd rather be near you &
your beautiful eyes
your oceans of dreaming
Shores only you can see
Me too! Can I come?
Your Vision is not what
They do looking past,
you
I'd like to see what you see
Seems fun
