# The Harder Fight

I day-dreamed about time-traveling
to a bar to fist fight my Dad. Same age
The dreamed ended
I awoke defeated

I would—I know him
He trained HARD, he swam in Arizona
You swim hard where there is no
water

In one dream of mine, I woke up
Having survived a nuclear explosion
Having dreamed of Death
I awoke elated

I do not know that; I've not burned
The ever-present threat; never happened
Just robbed the children of their innocence
With political panic

A final dream:
I spoke to some acolyte 
Who demanded that I read a book,
The total catastrophic explanation

Not only did I refuse 
I convinced this apparition
That she also was dreaming
So, who, then, was the dreamer?

All my strength lay in persevering
And stamina reveals no secrets while
corridors of anxiety in the mind 
Can't beat God and don't want to

You put the prayers in place
In order to alleviate the anxiety
"in God's hands" now
So that remembering the worry is the sin

But I've gotten hit in the face and just knocked out; "in God's hands"
And not forgotten—
just some stupidity that came
From nobility
—infected in me
by ideas born
before me

Big, unnamed, forgotten thugs 
Re-surface at Captain Jack's in Jersey City
Where in the past I'm dumb enough to stand
Between a bully and a target
apart from me

a "friend", and
like a sack of potatoes, I go down

"Wow. I've a glass jaw"
I've worked so little at fighting
And it's been a luxury; still
every other day I think this:

The difference between the punch
And getting in the way of it is like
A wave from the high tide coming
Standing with your back to the Pacific
You will not see it
Or notice when it knocks you down 

To care counts hard. And it
hurts, standing between the tide and a wall
And the wall will be the thing you
Wail at later, because
the ocean will never answer you

Then again, my thoughts
don't hold sway over me
and here I am writing...
"I've a glass jaw"?
"I'm a sack of potatoes"?

I won't go down every time
And being not my thoughts,
Being made of beach and dirt
I am both mythic champion
and useless automaton

What is? false about
A dumb, naïve punishment bag
that means to
protect the less
or give
In the midst of a  sound thump against the skull that
resonates in your jaw?
Only the intent
And in that; pain—
Not much else

Beaten, stand anyway
The world owes you one thing—
One thing only, on the day you are born:
Death

I might have been right
I was probably wrong
I was misguided and still
I was firm
After... embarrassed... no less willing
I know 
We still must stand against that ocean
