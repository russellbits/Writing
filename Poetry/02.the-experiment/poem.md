# The Experiment
This is the experiment.
It will go on for some time.
As long as you can know,
it will continue.
You will be a nothing and a darkness and
a void some day,
but not so long as you look
at these words.

Here, the void is a memory.
You are here.
Right here; this word.
And this poem is a map.
A map that gets you right to
the dream you need to be.
The dream you have always believed.

You have always known it.
In your heart.
And it is never more clear than here.
You are here.
Here you are.
Smile. For the picture.
This is the experiment.

It will go on for some time.
As long as you can know,
It will continue.
Because when it stops, so have you.

And the world will spin.
