# Spin Around

This massive around and everything we know
careens a slender tricky balance
tripping round fast
the way it does—25,000mph—we slip
past paying attention to our own deep
surface slick; hardly there
until, there you are!

How's that?—
peel layers, time passes
all the unknown gossip (who cares)
is hardly spoke then but for shock
and your unchanging (or changed as much)
visage of long ago makes now: yesterday
25,000mph and of course
So nice for it, when we were foolish and
foolish was happy once slipping unknown
into wine we no business had to crush or consume
a hundred thousand thousand rotations ago

an old face
a good face
a trusty aquiline face
an opal ring
and time to study
or none at all

The unknown upon us
Oh, now so mundane
despite that we never thought
the humdrum would catch us
then and not even now
so we joke these streets straight
on our way while pirouette
leaving us when and where
in intersections we greet
Chicago or Austin
Charlotte or Virginia Beach
It is not odd to find
that face we love
when we spin like we do.
