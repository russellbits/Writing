I saw a swollen sky today
Burning as though alive
And I glanced to see
The same fire that lie
Beneath you softened cheek

I saw a sullen sky today
Whose fury ripped with dangerous might
And I looked to see
The power released like brilliant light
In your reluctant smile

I saw a peaceful sky today
Calmed and still life fur
And I started to see
That you looked at me
And myself at ease
