The juries chase me down
Looks of hanging tragic actualization
While I dive into color pools
And try to drown in dreams
The fate fulfills itself though
My leg they've grabbed and pulled
The dreams seem down so
And a fish I am
To the master plan
Lurch and breathe now
Fly how?
I can't
So I just get a job
