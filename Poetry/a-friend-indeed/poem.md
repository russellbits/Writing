Where creature comforts
Are a world away
But Spring's arrived
And sure to stay
When lonely hearts look
But look away
Stay a while with me

When security is
A distant dream
And the past comes
Undone, by its seams
When upon a shoulder
You must lean
Stay a while with me

For though rivers run
And leafs will fall
You must climb past
Your protective wall
Look for friends
Through it all
And a while with me

In the end, a friend
Is what I'll be
So stay a while
Right here, with me
