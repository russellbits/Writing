Where creature comforts
Are a world away
But Spring's arrived
And sure to stay
When lonely hearts look
But look away
Stay a while with me

When security is
A distant dream
And the past comes
Undone, it still seams
When upon a shoulder
You must lean
Stay a while with me

For though rivers run
And leaves will fall
You must climb past
Your protective wall
Look for friends
Through it all
And in the while with me

At the end, a friend
Is what I'll be
So stay a while
Right here, with me
