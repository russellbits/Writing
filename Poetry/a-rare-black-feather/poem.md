The crow she came at dawn
black and purple against the sun
she cawed but once
and then she flew away

I followed her
into the broil
fought through thickets
of my own turmoil
to catch a glimpse
of sullen black
and feel myself float away

we're all but called
to knock death's door
as she caws our names
to beg a fall
and sweetly do
our souls go crying
like crow's dreams
