When they told us to keep apart,  
That we must not be seen but our eyes  
Many acquiesced, retreated inside  
Some defied and many died,  
But we all knew the era previous  
The birth of a century had       vanished  
A new middle had begun  
With unknowns many  

From our homes, our burrows,  
Our glass houses, our handheld views  
We zoomed, we slacked, we zapped, we twittered  
to one another in the space of silences  
Sometimes words of hope,  
lead to pleas for help,  
virtual virtuous     circles  
To hold each other up but not touch  
strung up on fingers that typed  

I came to it—to love—  
through fear, loss, fires and riots.  
I evacuated one home for another  
and left my chosen world for the safety  
of an old one. There was hope in retreat  
Though I found there I might rot,  
It was better than to keep hoping.  
For all the want I had was gone.  

My hope. My axe. Was dull.  
Having chopped one burning door after another,  
Having held one friend after another,  
Having seen the tears,  
Having locked the child's seat in the car,  
Having pushed the animals into the trailers,  
While the smoke rushed red and orange  
Across our skies  
And choked us  

My axe was dull.  

My nights were dark.  

I saw mostly only smoke before my eyes,  
and listened to whispers about how to  
fight invisible particles.  

I poked all around the looking screen.  
It holds an infinite place.  
What you seek you can find,  
and I found a smile that was contagious.  

I chanced to drop a line into a glass  
that turned out to be an ocean  
whose blue eyes I couldn't  
see
would capture me
So willingly

In the midst of danger recent gone  
Came danger in a different form  
The challenge to think, to wake  
She gave ecstasy to me  
through asking me  
what I was all about anyway?  

She sought too, some dove with a branch  
Some idiot that, by chance, could make her laugh  
the reasoned conversation right out,  
the absurd reigned that small carved space  
And in between the texts, the messages,  
the speaker and the microphone  
A garden began to happen.  

I don't know how it is possible  
that I never knew her.  
I dream only of her by my side  
I dream only of her head on my shoulder  
I dream only of her blue eyes  
And I dare to dream of what she  
Will say next  
To make me laugh again.  

Through the Looking Screen  
We fell in love,  
Our digital record alive on the wires  
Though we retain secrets  
We retain infinitudes  
For our worlds to collide  
Makes everything more possible  

My axe is sharpened.  
And I am ready for anything, again.  
Her. Muse. Angel. Lava Lamp. Honeysuckle.  
The lights fade. It feels like this world  
Might be crumbling.  

"Hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and   clutch, feeling lucky. It is an ax you break down doors   with in an emergency."  
—Rebecca Solnit  

My axe is ready,  
And I believe I can feel her hands  
With mine on the hilt.  
Her steel blue eyes  
That stare into me let me know—  

I can only see now; that all of it,  
The loss, despair, the low and burns  
were needed. To temper the steel.  

This weekend I will see her for the first time in many,   many years.  
You all had better watch out.  
Two stars are about to collide.  
And I don't know what happens next  
Except for this:  
Our love is about to break the glass in case of emergency.
