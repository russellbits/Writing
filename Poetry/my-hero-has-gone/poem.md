I look to the woods
Can see between the trees
Dumb graves, lost
The deepest dark, the finished
The end they call it
I admire, they are gone
Deep in that forgotten

I'll go there too
But I'll just laugh
In the meantime
I don't mind
Come to me, Darkness
You got nothing on me.

I'm gonna go find love
And in your end
The middle of it
I'll laugh
When you come,
I know your name

And well you know me sure
But I'll just stay here
A minute
I know you take
Everything away
That's fine.

Come at me, Darkness
I got something you are not sure of
A different end
Windows
Places
Hopes
Dreams
Come at me, Darkness.
