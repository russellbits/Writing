I cast stones into pools of thought in the hopes that the ripples would make some dreams
Casting stones into a pool of thoughts about why I am who I am makes ripples in the reality that I need to see
And thoughts that ripple tend to fall from the gravity of sanity
and makes me wonder less about the edge
edges like love
*So my vision swells to encompass all that can't be with a large yellow moon in the sky over our heads my vision swells and your sight shows it how to*
When your eyes smile at me, a thousand birds take off to fly south in your holy wintry glare
They wish that you could see what I see with the bundle of nerves in my sockets
I see you glow and warm and melt the snow that's as white as desire
Watch the paper fly in the wind of our laughter and watch the silently slipping spirits as they leave
Because with this sight, I can see.
