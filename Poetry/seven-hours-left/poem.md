Welcome is a warm word
In this drafty old place
This drafty cold place
As I sit with seven hours left

No one sees the simple
meditations that provide
A warmth within my heart
Coming from inside

In this drafty old place
With 7 hours left

I think I will just sit
Sit and endure the cold
Ignore the anger old
And fit inside my globe
Until the hours gone away
Lead me far away
Far from the cold of

Seven hours left
