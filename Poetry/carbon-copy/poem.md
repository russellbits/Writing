Traversing stone stairs
out into night air
there comes
a light breeze, shock of infatuation
materializes slowly
in curls wet with night
and thoughtful eyes, a laughing nature

Follow my eyes, this curious glow
shining out upon a happy party confusion
I thinkâ€”hope perhaps
she and I could be one

Luck, has my existence realized
as names are passed in friendly fashion
And I linger
Must I slow the flame to keep
  from burning?
Or peruse the chase, this,
  love's sweet gosling?
(so fuzzy, young and needing warmth)
produced sometimes by dance
well, two steps to one
Make an embarrassed flourish
(As my audience desire waits in the wings of hesitation)

Remains not long though
for quick slip, accidental hand hold
reveal this old isolation cold kept
surprise of kiss, momentary glance
cave in all revelation

(Ingredients, too, to make my adrenaline cocktail)

So I am happy again
Though she moves lightly on
"How nice" is all I think to whisper
