# But I am Killing Myself

It's like lift-off on a rocket
The panic, the thrill
Like falling at the starting gun
The glory followed quick by failure
Like seeing and knowing what the hell
the Sun IS the first time, child,
knowing even in ITS end
ALL the end, still we resist what
Death is

Takes a fort of time
What nest of good you've 
Packed away in that deep tree
Up, way up, in the branches
Is all the good-to-go you've
Got when that shabby sonuvabitch
Sabotages you; Dark inevitable surprise
Launch or vanish

Watch that chain you're making
Pulling out your insides to form rope
A knot, a noose, that even that Shadow—cloaked
didn't promise you;
The new day might make you fight
but days and days and days will tire you

His coming IS; Being awake is optional
Poor old Death: blamed for everything—
Except his job, made the day
You were created
Accept his covenant
And get on with the launch,
The forward, the start, the move,
The fall, the failure, the debt,
The beginning, the genesis, the over-under,
the loss, the dread, the cowardice
It's nothing to do with the cost
He's already taken and will take everything
Will take everything
But the Unknown
He's taken and will take everything 
But the Unknown

If that cowled, black skeleton
Hates at all,
He must hate that variable,
Of which you are singularly made

When you are not being a ghost
And repeating like a haunting
Your horrors, your terrors, your life
regrets and failures
You are elusive and a thief of time 

Isn't it odd? How well we know
His countenance, His unbearable grinning face
A skull, Death’s myth
To know so little of the countenance
Of his little sister: Chance?

If your book is to mean
And not glean or attract or glorify
To not brag or beg or to be righteous
Then it's your's and your's alone
As you pass into His night’s cloak
Maybe don't erase the chains

Have the chains, own the chains 
Ignore the chains

Perhaps your path is a strange one
and your companion is the little
cloak that speaks of chaos past Big Old Death

She slips and slides confident between
prediction, science, or pundits;
She says anything, in the meantime
is All that happens just the same
chaos
probability
a little dark blue hood, I think,
Chance is a fellow thief and a friend

In between all the advanced ape’s shouting—
loudspeakers and televisions, surely,
some of us slip unawares of the cameras
and there is a new way of living
devoid of focus; attention everywhere
It looks like electric death
It seems like an undercurrent
But its just chance and quiet
Quite devoid from the erased spectrum of
famous and infamous—long gone now that
everyone is known

It’s the little sister of Death
Blue-hooded like twilight that should lead us
Because Death is Old and Boring and
Becoming more so.
The electric soul is inevitable.
We, you and I might not make it,
But the rest of us can, and why bother
if it is to be nothing but a new world
of mirrors and not the glory of
betterment and exploration
of a universe intent on dying of a heat death?
He’s already here!

He’s here. He’s waiting in the wings.
Why must we give over the stage to his empty skull?
Why must we vanish into the night?
And should we choose otherwise,
Who then, do we ally our purpose with?
The skull in black?
The face in blue?
The forest or the desert?
The famous or infamous?
The learned or the projected?
The loudspeaker or the discussion?
The freedom or the automaton?
The lift-off or the panic?
The calm or the noise?
He comes.
The choice and time imminent remains.
