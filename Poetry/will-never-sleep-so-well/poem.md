My old friend
is falling asleep
just outside my window

I watch him nod and shift
I watch him shed
his thousand tiny hands
turned red then brown

as he drifts away
on the longest dream
(That I can imagine, anyway)

I think, "How difficult
to take so long
to be so slow
for months
just to fall asleep."

But he doesn't hear me I think
He may be already snoozing

I turn to all
the things I have to do
the tasks and errands
required of those who don't sleep seasons
that despite my efforts
there is so much to do before I sleep

To him again, I think
I will never be so old
Nor sleep as well.
