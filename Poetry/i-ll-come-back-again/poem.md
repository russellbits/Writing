Free
As I am to roam
at times I cannot see
the night comes down
my thoughts abound
I seem to lost me

As I walk
across star-studded nights
I find the periodic home
the warmth of the fire
and someone to hold
a place to call my own

please forgive me
at times I walk away
fooled by dangerous rainbows
that call me off to play
they carry me afar
tell me to go home some other day

please forgive me
for wandering, though I am
I will always find again your hand
the light of your smile
my north star
