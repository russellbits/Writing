The whooping boys came out and gathered
Their necks like frogs, their calls like wolves
And spliced the city into microparts
terrain too tight to turn in
terrain that they would burn in
with only root beer left for brains

Out came the maidens, two by two
For what should be a drunken slaughter
The whooping boys would overwhelm
Protrude sweet fuzz with their slime
And run away like goblins such
Leaving bodies white and blind

Soon the night would pass on through
And vengeance would have the sun
When comes down the holy fire bug
To burn away their nasty fun
She,
Lady biology
Might check her watch
And squish them all in a line
