Cold or shaken
Burned or broken
Gainsay has that certain
Secondary quality
All fallen from grace
The grace of light

Brazers sun shut off
Lucent light leave now
Collapse then in an infinite
Finiteness
Nothing
Not even black
To explode the consciousness
Again and again
Cold or shaken
Burned or broken
