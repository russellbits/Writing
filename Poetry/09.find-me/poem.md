# Find me

Kate,




Love.
Me pulling my socks up in bed
because this whole mattress got jacked
and it wasn't just my fault  
and still the edges were  
it was yours too  
my bed was yours    
And looking goofy is a small  
Price to pay  
When they bark under  

God damn I've got to clean up  
but then, I suppose I was gonna anyway  
before you showed up  
There were goals before crushes  
Your presence is pleasure after  
Best of all you did not mind a bit  
The missing of a day  
Neither did I...  
Neither did I  

And you, well, then  
Irritation will come, as we discussed  
Your concern with the future tense  
Precious  
hollowed and find your boots elsewhere  
but hike that with me,  
no worries  
Me, sycophant,  
You, over it in your head  
With sparks still &  
Still fun in the middle  

We'll just get burgers and  
hang out at the park  
That’s all just us... we might  

god damn it—I’lm out of steam. Hang on  

OK. Poetry. Hang on a second:  

This is all nonsense  
of my own design; you are gorgeous  
its a strange feeling that captures us—  
find me
