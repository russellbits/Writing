she lives on second avenue
among newstands, barreling traffic (sometimes
still), whistling for taxi cabs, buying barter
ing, trading and a one,000 hollering shaking
cheering giving taking easymove figures with
somewhere else to go.       she listens from above

cinnamon nutmeg hand, dotted hereandthere, rests
and soothes a smooth stomach (dotted hereandthere)
caressing her belly she hand lightly rests swirled
above a din and hum flows downtown honks and
screeches   winter blue and cold gray outside
huddle the window and cuddles scarf hat glove
covered folk, mad and happy with
somewhere else to go.

not to slide easily from her sunlit filtered
burrow (warm with incense sweetness) unadorned
curiosity flowers grow up from large brown eyes
to bloom when they press the ceiling.       she sighs
a sound above the hurleyechoboomswish and clang
    and a dog barks

Mademoiselle of church bells laughs at white noise
she hears the joke and punch line stowed like gold
underground buried there on second avenue.

[The poetagrafik version]

she lives on second avenue
newsstands, barreling traffic (sometimes
still) whistling for taxi cabs
from her burrow (pungent with incense sweetness)
curiosity flowers grow
to bloom when they press the ceiling.
she sighs
above the hurleyechoboomswish and clang
