For twenty years now
I've come to see in me
A tick and fragrant mystery
Who speaks in doubtful questions
And takes to fly on wings
Of soiled wax and bones
Burning still from memories
Of friends who've never known
The brilliance of my sun

I've worried in the wastelands
And chanced the ocean's guile
Sure I could defile
The idol statues that were
All along just photographs
Of me

Where can I go?
Where's Copeland?
I have so much to give
In shackles rusted, chains that lay
And you've no keys in this cave
But powers now
To burst the wall

I yell this to some shadow man
Whose cloak is drawn and tight
But when I question him
He removes this cowled night
And staring there is me
