#Architect of Accident. 
The three quarter clouded moon. 
over ocean’s persistent crystal light. 
dances a path to walk. 
alone in a night-time myopia. 

silence that stills the heady  
dialogue of bright day. 
and the moon’s wide and fuzzy halo. 
is a quiet amphitheater. 

for the performance of ocean waves. 
their dark body, bright foam, 
an inverted tide
come to take all of
your should’ves away.
and lap
deep thunderous.

At the First far falling star
overhead, you sit in awe alone
wide-eyes peeled to bay of light
Her communique
She to you alone, who walks this late

who came to worship the temple of
the architect of accident
when all the voices insisted and
hitch hiked on you to this quiet place
you came alone to. The voices
fall silent one by one
until left are none

and the second falling star
Burns a real thing, not a dream

And the ocean, not something to fathom
but a place to land—
as all falling stardust must

and you are cold
and you are shivering
sitting on a wide beach of white sand
the wind with its job to do
your vigil is aside

the three quarter and clouded moon
looking down on you
shines white light that is
a secret from the sun bounced
‘round the solar system
and
there is no one else watching

but *you*
who’ve come
this late at night
for the show that
goes on
for as long
as forever
is gonna be
