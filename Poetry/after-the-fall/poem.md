Whispers quiet in the darkness
Of a body held
Tense and wet
		with her tears
frame you he will
to be placed on that mantle
in the foyer of his love
two years, two days, two minutes
The cardboard box will swallow her.

Glass shattered
Hands bloodied by it
She will achieve her quiet
She longed for it
Free from harsh words and
		bloodshot eyes
In the marked darkness
Of the bottom
To come again but won't
Resolute acquaintance
Familiar stranger
And pained glances
As they slide by
In the salmon flow
