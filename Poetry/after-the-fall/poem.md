Whispers quiet in the darkness
Of a body hold
Tense and wet
		with her tears
frame you he will
to be placed on that mantle
in the foyer of his love
two years, two days, two minutes
The cardboard box will swallow her
Glass shattered
Hand bloodied by it
She will achieve her quiet
That quiet she longed for
Free from harsh words and
		bloodshot eyes
In the marked darkness
Of the bottom of his box
To come again but won't
Resolute acquaintance
Familiar stranger
And pained glances
As they slide by
In the salmon flow
