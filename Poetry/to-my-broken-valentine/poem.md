Many lonely ghosts haunt me still
Of soiled dreams I know I can't fulfill

Wishes that I never thought
Things too good, I never sought

And all the salted tears I never gave
Come back to wash me to my grave

Though I am not blind and set
Upon making good of what I get

I stand for all time to see
What I might make of what I receive

I never think I get too much
Of wealth and luck and love and such

But often I find I hesitate
To observe my self-made lonely fate

There you stand like a star
Rising new to guide me far

Reminding me of who you are
And why I love you so

So I curse myself because I failed
Angry that my greed prevailed

I looked away not out of pride
But because I am not perfect

I'll love you as much as one man can
My pride aside I'll always stand

And wait for you on the other side
Of our deep and heart-felt tears
