In New York, I think when I was living on 72nd street and Central Park West, there was enough of a winter and snow that there was a pond in the park that was frozen over. To my memory that was the first time I ever walked on ice. So, I called my Mom on my cell phone and was in the middle of telling her how exciting it was when another nosey New Yorker comes over and tells me to get off the phone and enjoy the surroundings. Joe Clancy was really proud of me because I had a New Yorker moment and told that guy to “Fuck off, I’m talking to my mother!”
