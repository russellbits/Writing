I'm in Tempe, Arizona, after my grandmother's funeral. It was actually my first funeral. I suppose that I expected to be surprised by what it would be like, because others told me I would, but in the end it was what I expected. And it was nice (except for the cynical priest.) Everyone in the family stood up and talked about her and what they loved about her. I spoke too. I talked about how infectious her energy and joy wasâ€”about how her accomplishments were greater than  when viewed through her pride. And I spoke about her hands. She suffered from severe arthritis (to the point her fingers were twisted around at the knuckles.) but that in my memory she never complained or even mentioned it. It never seemed to to stop her or slow her down. She still smiled all the time and did everything she could for herself (even typing out letters.)
