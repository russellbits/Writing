# Writing, R. E. Warner
I don't know if it's the footlocker stacked to the brim with spiral-bound notebooks, staring at me and waiting to catch fire or get soaked, or if it's that I'm on my something-like eighth laptop, but it's time to centralize my writing—all of it, as much of it as I can find.

Why? Why not? I suppose philosophically—abstractly—I recognize that everything is temporary. All art will ultimately be destroyed. Even if we escape this little rock of ours, I doubt most of our artifacts will survive the heat-death of the universe. Maybe they will if they’re digital. Maybe beyond smallest dimensions of space where gravity spirals into nothing, there is a giant github repository where all information about the universe and its progress is digitally stored in bits of existence and nonexistence.

It’s be nice. But until that discovery is made, I’m just trying to put everything I’ve ever written in one place in the cloud. I’ve no delusions about the trappings of celebrity; I don’t want to be a known writer. It’s just that I get such joy from the idea that someone might read something I’ve written and enjoy it! So here it all is. If it was published elsewhere, there’s a footnote in the text.

## Technical Note
This *is* Github, and even though this is my personal cache of writing, I’ve no problem with anyone cloning it and adding to it. Feel free to make corrections, add paragraphs, new characters, write a riff. I make no promises about merging your work with mine, but I’m open to the possibility (especially grammatical and spelling corrections). Leave issues, too. At this point, I see little difference between my writing and my code, which I suppose is part of the reason why I’m putting my writing here.
